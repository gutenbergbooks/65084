</div>

<p>“Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Ding-dong!”
clashed the great bell on the locomotive,
and with much creaking and clanking and letting off
of steam, with iron scraping on iron and one last, long
drawn whistle of the air-brakes, the train came slowly
to a stop.</p>

<p>As if vying with the locomotive to see which could
make the greater noise, a score or more of khaki-clad
boys came tumbling to the platform of the little
mountain station, amid whoops and cat-calls and
shouts of, “Here we are!” “Hurrah for the Adirondacks!”
“Say, fellows, this is the backwoods and
no mistake!”</p>

<p>And then in rapid succession came the further
inquiries:</p>

<p>“Which way do we go? Up this road?”</p>

<p>“See that big rock away down there? I’ll race
you to it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>The big collie Don, not to be behindhand when
there was any noise or capering to be done, and
more glad than anyone else to be released from
the many hours of close confinement in that awful
baggage car, ran wildly about, darting in and out
between the boys’ feet, at the imminent danger
of upsetting the whole procession, and added his
joyful bark to the general noise and confusion.</p>

<p>A couple of boys did go down, but were at once
on their feet and after Don, who&mdash;knowing and
wise dog that he was!&mdash;understood well that his
pursuers were his loyal friends, as he was theirs,
and felt no fear, but ran and doubled, and ran on
again, treating it all as the very best kind of a
joke.</p>

<p>A half hour of racing and tearing to given
points and back again, and impromptu games of
leapfrog and follow my leader gave vent to the
bubbling spirits held in check during the long journey
and the Scouts, once more looking like self-controlled
boys instead of cavorting wild Indians, settled down to
a walk.</p>

<p>This was the opportunity for which Mr. Durland
had been waiting to discuss plans for the season’s
camp.</p>

<p>The call to camp had been sent out so late that
most of the Scouts knew little beside the location
and duration of the camp; and now Scout-Master
Durland proceeded to enlighten them.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn of the previous year Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Scott, a very wealthy gentleman, had purchased
a large section of land in the Adirondacks&mdash;many,
many acres of ground, nearly a whole
county, in fact.</p>

<p>As it was late in the season, he had been forced
to postpone the inspection and surveying of the
tract until the next year, but in order to be ready
early in the summer, he had had a stout log house
erected, to serve as a shelter for whomever should
be sent out for the survey, and after that as a temporary
hunting lodge until a larger and more elaborate
one should be built.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott and the Scout-Master were warm
friends, and knowing the proposed plans for the
new lands, Mr. Durland had suggested making the
work the object of the Boy Scouts’ summer camp.
Mr. Scott, a firm believer and warm advocate
of the Boy Scout movement, had readily consented.</p>

<p>Because there was more or less danger in this
region of encountering a bear, or even a wildcat,
and as a rattlesnake was not altogether an impossibility,
it was thought advisable to use the lodge
as sleeping quarters instead of the usual tents or
lean-tos. A large shack would have to be built
for a mess tent, and a place to store provisions.</p>

<p>This tract of newly purchased land was in a section
uninhabited for a distance of many miles
around, as far as had been ascertained. The
county town was twelve miles away&mdash;not too far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
for an occasional trip for provisions, but as the
mountain roads were steep and rough, making the
going very difficult, an unusual amount and variety
of provisions had been sent with the Troop.
One or possibly two trips during the season would
be all that would be necessary to keep the camp
well stocked.</p>

<p>So much for the camp-building and welfare.
Now for an explanation of the work laid out for
the Scouts by Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>They were to be pathfinders in this hitherto
almost totally unexplored region. They were to
locate springs, brooks, streams, lakes, perhaps
rivers; note the kinds of fish to be found in these
waters and in what numbers; make lists of the
different trees, birds and animals to be found
upon it, and to group and classify them. They
were to ascertain the nature of the soil in different
sections, explore by-paths, and outline the
best and safest and shortest routes to the section
where any desired water or soil or bird or animal
was to be found.</p>

<p>Beside all this, they were to become so familiar
with the country for five miles around the
camp as to be able to guide any person at any
time, day or night.</p>

<p>A great work, surely, and one which, if well
and satisfactorily handled, might well cause any
boy’s heart to leap with pride.</p>

<p>The Scouts, sober enough now, had listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
with absorbed interest to all that Mr. Durland
had said. At the mention of bears and bobcats,
every boy had felt his heart thrill. Was there a
possibility of a real encounter with one of these
animals which, when seen even in the zoo, had
been terrifyingly fierce? Mr. Durland had said
that the possibility was so small that it was hardly
worth considering, but that there was even the
faintest chance was enough to make your heart
beat faster.</p>

<p>However, when he spoke so earnestly of the
great work outlined for them, and showed the
eager Scouts what splendid opportunities for
mental growth it would open to them, and what
a part this knowledge they were sure to gain
would play in their future success in life, each
Scout determined to do his very best and to make
the most of every opportunity.</p>

<p>So, at last, just at high noon, they came to the
place where they were to pitch their new camp,
and again the excitement broke out.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the log house or lodge, with
one accord they made for it, and in a great deal
less time than it takes to tell it, every nook and
corner of that house was explored.</p>

<p>They saw with satisfaction that the building
was very strong, and that the many windows, beside
being set with very thick glass, were provided
with perforated shutters of inch-thick solid
oak wood, closing from the inside. Ben Hoover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
expressed the general sentiment when he said,
“Those shutters certainly look good to me!”</p>

<p>Mr. Durland’s voice reminded them that if
everything was to be made shipshape in the new
camp before nightfall, there was no time now to
play, and from that moment the camp was a
busy scene.</p>

<p>The two Scouts who were detailed as cooks
were soon busy making a small fireplace on which
to cook their dinner. Placing three stones together,
they laid between them some whittled
shavings for kindlings, applied a match and, as
the fire commenced to burn, they placed over it
some twigs and dry wood, quantities of which lay
scattered about, and soon had a fine fire over
which to place their frying-pan.</p>

<p>In the meantime the hamper was opened and
when, in shorter time than you could have thought
possible, the call to dinner was sounded,
everyone came running. No one needed a second
call, and the way that bacon and crisp fried potatoes
and cornbread disappeared was a marvel.</p>

<p>Dinner over, one small squad was detailed to
unpack, while all the rest were pressed into
service to build the mess shack. This was finished
by five o’clock, and then each Scout gathered
branches of the fragrant balsam and hemlock for
his bed. Over these he spread his rubber blanket,
and over that his sleeping blanket, and he had a
bed soft and springy and comfortable enough for
a king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>Everything being in first-class order at last,
and ready for the night, a tired, hungry lot of
boys gathered around the supper table. As they
ate they talked of their impressions of the new
camp site, eagerly discussed the probable adventures
they would have, and then someone asked
Scout-Master Durland what kind of animals they
would be likely to find here.</p>

<p>Mr. Durland smiled and said he would rather
they would find that out for themselves.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack Danby, “from what I have
read, I am dead sure there is one little animal who
lives up here whose acquaintance I shall be very
glad to make.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” eagerly asked Bob Hart.</p>

<p>“The otter,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bob, disappointedly, “there’s
nothing so very interesting about an otter!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Jack, smiling, “after you
have had a chance to see him in his home and at
work, you will change your mind. I know you
will, for he is one of the most interesting of
animals. In certain parts of England, especially
near rivers, there used to be a great many otters,
and some of the fishermen trained them to catch
fish for them.”</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, you really don’t believe that, do
you?” said incredulous Bob.</p>

<p>“I have to believe it if it is true,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“How can they be trained to do that?” asked
Tom Binns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” explained Jack, “it is something like
this. A string was tied about the otter’s neck
in a sort of slip-knot that could be lightened when
the trainer wished. Then the trainer would say,
‘Come here!’ and pull on the string, so that
the otter would be drawn toward him.</p>

<p>“This was done several times, until the otter
connected the action with the words, and then
the string was dropped and he came obediently
without it at the words of command.</p>

<p>“Next a small, artificial fish was made and
placed on the ground before the otter, the string
pulled until he opened his mouth, when the fish
was placed in it, while at the same moment the
words, ‘Take it!’ were uttered. It would be a
long time before he would learn to do this, but
when he did, the string was again used while
he had the fish in his mouth and the command,
‘Drop it!’ was given.</p>

<p>“At last he learned to obey these two commands
without the use of the string. Then he was
taken to the edge of the water and a small, dead
fish thrown in and the command given him to
take it. He at once seized it, and at the word,
‘Drop it!’ yielded it to his master.</p>

<p>“Next live fishes were thrown in, and when
he had brought them, the heads were given to him
as his reward, and the little fisherman was always
ready for his work. In fact, one entire family
was supplied with food for a long time in this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>The result of this story was to make all the
Scouts wish that they might have a chance to
make Mr. Otter’s acquaintance.</p>

<p>As everybody was very tired, it was decided to
make no camp-fire that night, so after the roll-call
all were glad to throw themselves upon their
beds of fragrant balsam. They found them deliciously
comfortable, and many a tired New York
millionaire, tossing sleeplessly on his luxurious
couch, might have envied these sturdy Scouts as
they sank at once into the sleep that is the reward
of a healthy body, a clear conscience, and muscles
tired with honest effort.</p>

<p>Once in the night Mr. Durland was aroused by
a sleep-bound voice asking, “Are those shutters
closed? There might be a bear!” But no bear
more formidable than Ursa Major peeped through
the holes of the shutters, and sweet, restful sleep
held the tired Scouts in her embrace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="fs60">THE LOGGING CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Scouts arose early the next day, in order
to be able to march during the cool morning hours,
and so escape the torrid middle part of the day,
which is especially hot during the short northern
summer.</p>

<p>But although hot after the sun is up, the nights
seem all the colder by contrast. Fortunately, the
Scout-Master had foreseen this and had provided
for it by insisting that each Scout carry a warm
woolen blanket. To many of the boys this had
seemed a waste of energy at the time. Who on
earth could want a blanket at that time of the
year, they argued.</p>

<p>The first night in camp, however, proved the
wisdom of Mr. Durland’s course, and they were
glad enough to wrap their blankets around and
around them and lie close to each other for the
sake of warmth.</p>

<p>Ben Hoover expressed the general feeling when
he said, “We must all be crazy with the heat,
I think. By this time we ought to realize that
Mr. Durland knows what he is talking about.”</p>

<p>It had been arranged that today they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
make a visit to a logging camp which lay about
five miles in a westerly direction from their camp.</p>

<p>All the Scouts were eager to see the lumber
camp, and so stepped off smartly at the word of
command from Scout-Master Durland. If left
to themselves, most boys would probably have
run the first part of the way, but these Scouts
knew that five miles through the woods on such a
day as this promised to be was not any laughing
matter, so they went along slowly.</p>

<p>This did not suit Don, but he submitted with
good grace, like the Scout and gentleman he was.
He usually traveled about three miles to every
one that the boys made, anyway, darting off on his
own doggish errands and returning with a wise
look on his face. Whatever anyone else thought,
he evidently considered his expeditions of the
utmost importance.</p>

<p>Today, however, he restrained his exuberant
feelings, and walked along sedately with the rest
of his Troop, his magnificent brush waving slowly
from side to side. Even when a squirrel darted
across the path, he curbed his ardent desire to
chase it, and Jack petted him lovingly on the head.</p>

<p>“You’re just as good a Scout as any of us,
aren’t you, old boy?” he asked. “Even if you
haven’t taken the Scout oath, I know well enough
that you would if you could. When it comes right
down to having good principles, I guess you are
as good as any of us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Mr. Durland,
who had overheard the last part of his remark.
“If every man had as good and upright instincts
as that dog, the world would be a better place
than it is now.”</p>

<p>Jack saluted, and said respectfully, “Yes, sir,
I guess it would.”</p>

<p>It seemed no time after that until they were
surprised to come suddenly upon an opening in
the woods, and Mr. Durland said, smiling, “Well,
Scouts, we have arrived! While you are here, I
want you to keep your eyes and ears open, and
learn all you can about logging. Everything you
see will be interesting, so I have no doubt you
will have a good time. Remember, we are to
make a report on what we see, so we want to be
on the job. Now, forward, march!”</p>

<p>The Scouts defiled out into the open, and
started down the rough path toward the camp.
This was situated at the bottom of a hollow,
where it was sheltered somewhat from the wintry
blasts.</p>

<p>As the Scouts approached, they saw that it was
composed of two rough log buildings, one considerably
larger than the other. The larger structure
was the bunk house, where the lumberjacks
ate and slept, and the smaller one was the cook
house, or kitchen.</p>

<p>As the boys came nearer, they could see the
cook’s helper, or cookee, as he was called, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
outside the door, washing an immense pile
of dishes. He was engaged in a hot argument
with the cook, who was a peppery little French
Canadian.</p>

<p>“What you tink, by gar?” the latter was
shouting as they got within hearing distance.
“You tink I am goin’ to cook for dees here
bunch of hungry pigs, an’ den help you wash
dishes, also? Mon Dieu! What you take me for&mdash;what
you call zee easy mark?”</p>

<p>“There, there, Frenchy, keep your hair on!”
replied the cookee, a red-headed lad about the
same age as the Scouts, and then added, with an
exasperating grin, “If I couldn’t cook anything
better than the sour dough biscuits and the sinkers
you turn out, I’d be ashamed to take the boss’s
good money! Why don’t you get a job in New
York driving an ash cart? You’d look nifty in
one of them white uniforms, and then you
wouldn’t have a chance to kill off any more poor
lumbermen with your bum grub! That’s what
I’d do if I was you!”</p>

<p>This seemed to drive the excitable Frenchman
nearly frantic.</p>

<p>“Pig! Dog! Vile one!” he screamed. “Is it
zat you would mock me, child of ze gutter?”</p>

<p>The grinning boy appeared to take pleasure in
teasing the peppery cook, and finally the latter
seemed to go quite mad with rage. He grasped
a huge wooden spoon from a table beside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
door, and made a clumsy rush at his assistant.
The nimble boy easily eluded him, however, but
once or twice let the cook get so near him that the
little man felt encouraged to keep up the chase
in the hope of finally catching him. At last his
breath gave out, and he came to a standstill and
shook his fist wildly in futile rage.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Frenchy, fan the air all you
please,” shouted the evidently delighted youngster.
“It does you good, and doesn’t hurt me,
so we’re both happy.”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, zat is all!” gurgled the cook, his
face purple. “Soon ze boss, he will come back,
and zen you will see, little devil! He will&mdash;what
you call it? Make ze punching bag of you! Who
will be happy zen? I will laugh at you, so, ha-ha!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, laugh, old boy, it will ease your
mind!” said the boy, whom the cook had so aptly
described. “It may save you from having
apoplexy and croaking. Fat old guys like you
often go off just like that!” and he grinned and
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>The outraged cook could think of nothing to
say to this crowning insult, and retired into his
shack, muttering a string of variegated profanity.
After a short interval the boy returned to his
dish-washing, but kept a wary eye on the door,
prepared to cut and run at the first sign of
danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>The Boy Scouts had been interested spectators
of this scene, and now Mr. Durland stepped up
to the boy who had been the cause of all the
trouble, and said, “Can you tell me, my lad,
where I can find the foreman, if he is in camp?”</p>

<p>“The boss is away just now,” replied the boy,
civilly enough. “Wot’s yer business with him?
Shall I tell him you were here?”</p>

<p>“That depends on when he will be back,” replied
Mr. Durland. “Do you think he will be here
soon? If so, we will wait for him.”</p>

<p>“I guess he will, if you want to see him bad
enough to wait,” answered the boy. He seemed
willing enough to oblige, and Mr. Durland felt
sure that he was not a really bad boy, although it
is safe to say that the cook would not have agreed
with him.</p>

<p>“Who’s them guys with you?” asked the boy,
but with a note of respect in his voice that was
seldom heard there.</p>

<p>“That is a Troop of three Patrols of Boy
Scouts,” explained Mr. Durland.</p>

<p>“Boy Scouts?” echoed the boy. “I knew a
feller once who was a Boy Scout, and he said it
was nifty to be one. He said I could be one, too,
if I wanted to, and I did, but I thought he was
just kidding me. How is a guy like me, what
can’t even talk straight, goin’ to be a Boy Scout?”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason on earth why you shouldn’t
be one, if you really desire it,” said Mr. Durland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
kindly. “You can soon learn to ‘talk straight,’
as you call it, and once you have taken the Scout
oath, everything else will come of itself.”</p>

<p>The Scout-Master then went on to explain just
what being a Boy Scout meant, and the boy listened
attentively. When he spoke about the Scout
oath, the boy inquired:</p>

<p>“Just what is the oath, mister?”</p>

<p>“It is the oath that every boy desiring to become
a Scout must take, and once having done so,
he must stick to it through thick and thin,” explained
Mr. Durland.</p>

<p>“Well, I know now that I will want to join, but
could I have a little time to think it over?” inquired
Harry, for so his name proved to be.</p>

<p>“Why, surely!” replied Mr. Durland, cordially.
“We wouldn’t hurry you in your decision for a
moment. We will be in the camp off and on quite
a while, and you can let me know of your decision
at any time that suits you best. Just take your
time, my boy, and think it over.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir,” replied Harry, gratefully, and
turned again to his seemingly endless task.</p>

<p>The Scout-Master rejoined the boys, and they
all started on an inspection of the camp. As they
walked, Mr. Durland told Jack and Dick Crawford
about what the red-haired boy had said, and
they were as pleased as he over the prospect of
gaining a new Scout, when in this part of the
country nothing had been further from their
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>The clearing in which the logging camp was situated
covered several acres, and was hemmed in
closely by giant trees. Some of these had already
been nicked by the woodcutter’s axe, which
marked them as the next victims to the demands
of advancing civilization.</p>

<p>Not far from the camp ran a river, or at least
what was a river at certain seasons of the year,
though now it was little more than a large brook.
The boys could hear it murmuring through the
trees, and suddenly Tom Binns said:</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, I wonder if there’s any place
around here that we could take a swim? It’s getting
pretty hot, and I for one feel as if a good
swim would do me all sorts of good.”</p>

<p>There was a general shout of approval, and the
Scout-Master said, “Why don’t you see if you
can discover a pool of some kind?”</p>

<p>This was no sooner said than done, and the
boys, accompanied by Don, were plunging pell-mell
through the underbrush in the direction of
the river. Soon they emerged on the bank of the
stream, and after their hot run the thought of a
plunge in the cool, shady river was pleasant indeed.</p>

<p>Running along the bank, they discovered a
place where a fallen forest giant had formed a
natural dam, and the water was several feet deep.
It was not two minutes before every Scout was in
the pool, and oh, how grateful the cool, clear water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
felt! They splashed around, and in one place the
better swimmers found it deep enough for diving.</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t this a bully place?” shouted Jack.</p>

<p>“Bet your sweet life it is!” shouted one.</p>

<p>“I just guess yes!” agreed another.</p>

<p>Mr. Durland remained on the bank with Don
beside him. He could see that the dog wanted to
jump in with the boys, but felt that he ought not
to leave the Scout-Master alone. So Mr. Durland
picked up a dry stick and, showing it to Don, said,
“Here, boy, fetch it back!” and threw it into
the stream.</p>

<p>In three bounds Don had reached the brink of
the pool and dashed in, covering the boys with
spray. In less time than it takes to tell, he had
grasped the stick in his strong, white teeth, and
clambered up the bank.</p>

<p>Pausing only long enough to give himself a
shake, which sent a miniature shower into the air,
he ran proudly up to the Scout-Master and
dropped the stick at his feet. Mr. Durland patted
his wet head approvingly, and this performance
was repeated several times, much to the delight of
both boys and dog. When it came to swimming,
Don could beat any of them, and the water seemed
almost to be his natural element.</p>

<p>But time was passing, and at last the boys had
to climb out reluctantly and dress.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Bob Hart, “we’ll have to try to
get down here as often as we can,” and this sentiment
was heartily echoed by the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>They now proceeded to the camp, and when
they reached there found that the foreman, Mr.
Flannigan, had arrived a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Mr. Durland introduced himself, and handed
the foreman a letter from Mr. Scott. With many
grimaces and mutterings Mr. Flannigan finally
deciphered the letter and, looking up, remarked:</p>

<p>“Shure, an’ Mr. Scott says as how yer all
right, an’ by the same token, whativer Mr. Scott
says goes around here, him bein’ the boss. What
kin I be doin’ fur ye, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing very much,” answered Mr.
Durland with a smile. “We are commissioned
by Mr. Scott, as he no doubt tells you in his letter,
to get the lay of the land around here and make
a report to him. While we were about it, I
thought it would be a good chance to give my
Troop some idea of what a logging camp is like.”</p>

<p>“Shure, an’ it’s glad I’ll be to do what I kin
fur yez,” said Flannigan, scratching his head.
“But, bedad, it’s a poor time o’ the year to see a
loggin’ camp. Most of the brave b’ys is in town
or scattered around further north. At this time
o’ the year ’tis little we do besides nickin’ the
trees for the fall cut. Howiver, if I’m not mistaken,
here come the b’ys now fur supper, an’ if
ye don’t mind rough table manners, we’ll soon
have a bite to eat. Here, cook!” as that individual
bustled past, “set up an extra table in the
bunk house for the b’ys here. More’s the pity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
it’s not much we’ve got to offer ye, but such as it
is, there’s never any lack, and I guess ye kin make
out.”</p>

<p>By this time the lumbermen had arrived at the
house, and the boys thought they had never seen
a stronger or more healthy set of men. The sun
had tanned their bearded faces to a deep brown
hue, and as they dropped their heavy axes into
a corner, it was easy to see that each one was as
strong as two ordinary men.</p>

<p>They all muttered a “How d’ye do” to Mr.
Durland, and took their seats around the rough
table in silence.</p>

<p>Obedient to instructions, the cook had stretched
a wide plank between two barrels, and this served
Mr. Durland and his Troop as a table. The boys
were not in a mood to be critical, and so long as
they got something to eat, did not care much what
kind of a table it was served on.</p>

<p>Harry, the red-headed cookee, now entered,
bearing a huge platter of steaming beans. This
was followed by other dishes of biscuits, doughnuts
and great cups of black coffee.</p>

<p>The lumbermen fell to with a rush, and it was
wonderful to see the way in which the eatables
vanished. They ate like famished wolves, and
the Scouts, hungry as they were, almost forgot
to eat, and could only stare at the spectacle and
wonder how the men ever did it.</p>

<p>However, you may be sure that their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
hunger soon asserted itself, and, as Ben Hoover
expressed it, they began to “feed their faces.”</p>

<p>The food was very good in its way, and the boys
made a hearty meal. The lumberjacks, however,
were through almost before the Scouts had begun,
and had gone outside, there to smoke their pipes
and swap yarns of perils by wood and water.</p>

<p>Soon the boys followed them, and ranged themselves
on the grass, listening to the whoppers that
the inventive men told. It must be admitted that
most of the yarns had some foundation of truth,
but on this had been reared an elaborate structure
of events that had happened only in the imagination
of the man telling the story.</p>

<p>After a while they started singing a rough lumberman’s
song, and some of the boys joined in
the chorus. Tom’s clear, piercing voice rang out
above the thunderous bass of the men like foam
on the crest of the wave, and when they had finished,
the men gazed at him admiringly.</p>

<p>“That there kid,” said one great, bearded fellow,
who at one time had been a cowboy on the
western plains, “is sure goin’ to be some shakes
as a singer when he grows up. I bet he’ll be in
opry some o’ these days. I knew a feller on the
Panhandle as could sing like that oncet, but he
<em>would</em> borrow hosses as didn’t belong to him, and
so we all strung him up one fine mornin’. It sure
seemed a shame to strangle that voice of his’n,
but it had to be did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p>He gazed meditatively out over the tops of the
trees, and a big fellow called Pete said:</p>

<p>“Say, boy, why don’t you bane give us a
song?”</p>

<p>Tom was about to refuse, when Mr. Durland
said, “Go ahead, Tom. Sing <cite>My Old Kentucky
Home</cite>, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Tom drew a deep breath and
started the Southern song.</p>

<p>In the hush of the great north woods, his wonderful
voice floated out in liquid melody, and the
men sat entranced. Visions of childhood days,
when they had sat at some distant fireside, came
up before them, and more than one hardened
“scrapper” felt a lump rise in his throat and
his eyes grow moist.</p>

<p>As the song was finished there was a short
silence, and then someone said in a husky voice:
“Say, kid, that was great! I’ll bet your father is
proud of you. I would be, if I was your dad! Sing
some more, will yuh?”</p>

<p>Tom sang song after song, until it was almost
dark, and the Scouts were forced to leave.</p>

<p>All the men followed the boys to the edge of
the clearing, and here they parted.</p>

<p>“Youse b’ys has given us an iligant evenin’,
bedad, and it’s us that thanks ye, although we
can’t do it in none of them flowin’ speeches like
the poetry fellers does. All we kin say is as how
we hope ye’ll come early and often, and stay
late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>There was a hearty chorus of, “We sure will!”
and “Much obliged, Mr. Flannigan!” from the
boys, and as Mr. Durland shook hands with the
boss of the camp, he said:</p>

<p>“We certainly have been royally entertained,
Mr. Flannigan, and want to thank you for it.”</p>

<p>“Shure, an’ it’s yourselves that has done the
entertainin’,” responded the foreman, with a
comical grin.</p>

<p>“Well, good-night, everybody!” shouted the
Scouts in chorus, and were answered by a good-natured
mumble from the deep-chested woodmen.</p>

<p>“Forward, march!” called Scout-Master Durland,
and the Boy Scouts started on their return
journey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="fs60">THE OLD SNAKE HUNTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The boys&mdash;Jack, Tom and Bob&mdash;set off one
morning at the Scout-Master’s direction for the
bluestone quarries situated about a mile from
the lodge. Don rushed joyfully ahead, barking at
squirrels, who looked at him tantalizingly from
safe retreats in the trees, chasing rabbits into
their burrows, and making himself altogether disagreeable
to the astonished inhabitants of the
forest.</p>

<p>The way to the quarries was not an easy one.
The boys had to climb over great rocks, descend
the steep sides of mountains, slipping and sliding
most of the way; they had to make a path through
stout vines that reached from tree to tree and
seemed determined not to let them pass. Still
they went steadily forward, for what Scout would
ever think of complaining or, worse yet, of turning
back with a task half done?</p>

<p>Finally they saw before them through the trees
a small hut before which an old man of strange
appearance was standing. He wore an old brown
hunting suit, so old and threadbare, in fact, that
the boys wondered how it ever managed to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
together; his leather leggings were strapped
securely just below the knee. In his hand he held
an implement that looked like a pitchfork, but
which had only two prongs, and in his mouth was
a huge pipe that sent up a cloud of smoke at
every puff. And although his face was all criss-crossed
with wrinkles, the few people who knew
him forgot all about that when they caught the
kindly gleam of his dark eyes, which were just as
keen and bright at sixty as they had been at
twenty.</p>

<p>Don trotted up and down and regarded the old
man, with one paw raised and his head cocked
inquiringly on one side, confident of welcome.</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll be durned!” said the old fellow
scratching his head in perplexity. “If that dog
ain’t the image of my Rover what got drowned
down in the river yonder a year ago come Monday!
Seems like he might almost be Rover’s
sperret; that is, ef I was to believe in sech things.
Come here, doggie, an’ ’splain yerself! One minnit
ye ain’t there an’ next minnit ye air! Whar
be ye from?” and he laid his hand gently on the
big dog’s head.</p>

<p>Just then the boys came into the cleared space
in front of the cabin and saluted the old man courteously.</p>

<p>“Waal, you be pow’ful fine youngsters,” he
said, fairly beaming with delight at the unexpected
visit. “Be this your doggie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>“You bet your life he is!” Bob asserted,
proudly. “Jack here is his real owner, but we
all have a part interest in him. We come from
the Boy Scouts’ camp about a mile back,” he went
on to explain, “and we’re bound for the bluestone
quarries.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll be durned!” again said the old
man, knocking the ashes out of his pipe. “Seems
to me I heerd somethin’ ’bout a boys’ camp
t’other day when I was down in town. Layin’
out that new ’state or whatever you call it, beant
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re locating lakes and brooks and different
kinds of trees, and we’re getting great fun
out of it, too,” Jack replied; then added, “I’m
afraid we’ll have to get along, fellows. We’ve
got quite a way to go yet.”</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry, boys? ’Tain’t so often
Old Sam has company drop in to see him that
he’s glad to see ’em go. Why can’t ye stay and
hev a bite o’ somethin’ to eat with me? I am
bound for the quarries myself to get the ile from
any o’ them pesky snakes what are fools enough
to let me ketch ’em. I kin show you a durn sight
better road there than any you know of.”</p>

<p>The boys, who had brought some lunch with
them, were only too glad to accept Old Sam’s
kind invitation. Don, who had felt a lively regard
for the old man from the first minute he looked at
him, trotted contentedly into the cabin with the
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p>The old man was so happy to have someone to
talk to that he kept up a continual chatter as he
put the frying-pan on the stove and sliced some
bacon.</p>

<p>“You see,” he was saying, “it was like this,
boys. We had had a turrible late spring same’s
we’ve had this year an’ the river was pow’ful
swollen an’ angry like, along o’ the snow meltin’
an’ comin’ down from the mountains. Waal, my
Rover an’ me, we wuz walkin’ along when all o’
a sudden we heerd a child screamin’. Sez I to
Rover, sez I, ‘It’s ’bout time, my boy, that we
wuz findin’ out the meanin’ o’ that there scream.’</p>

<p>“Rover seemed like he wuz o’ the same opinion,
cuz before I had time to git the words out o’ my
mouth, away he went like a streak. When I got
to the river, I see my Rover gather hisself together
and spring into the river, makin’ straight
fer a little patch o’ white that I took fer a child’s
dress. It didn’t take long fer me to git my coat
off and foller him, let me tell ye!”</p>

<p>The boys, deeply interested, waited impatiently
while Old Sam turned a slice of bacon, and then
continued, reminiscently:</p>

<p>“Waal, by the time I had fit my way as fur as
from this stove to the door, I see Rover comin’
back with a little piece o’ white in his mouth. He
swum much slower and feebler than he done at
fust, and I could see that the strain was tellin’
on him turr’ble. I swum as fast as I could to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
meet him. Purty soon up he come, stickin’ on to
that piece o’ white like he would sooner give up
his own life than let go, but when he looked up at
me so pitiful like I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” Here the old man
choked and drew his hand hastily over his eyes,
stealing a glance at the boys to see if they had
noticed his weakness, but finding them all looking
in the other direction, then, putting the bacon on
the table, he went on:</p>

<p>“Waal, I put out my hand to take hold o’ the
little child, an’ Rover, he let go jest too soon and
the little one went under. I dove down, and soon
felt the dress in my hand. When I got to the
top, I jest nat’ally looked to see whar my Rover
wuz, but I couldn’t see him nowhere. It hurt me
turr’ble to go in without findin’ him, but I knowed
my strength wouldn’t hold out much longer, so I
had to use it while there wuz any left. Waal, I
never could remember how I swum the rest o’ the
way to shore, but I got thar some way, an’ found
a crowd o’ people thar, glad enough to take the
child after I had saved it. They told me how
brave I wuz, too, but I turned on ’em, kind of
fierce like, an’ said:</p>

<p>“‘It wuzn’t me as done it! It was my Rover,
and he’s dead now. Dead, d’ye hear that?’ an’
then I jest walked away with my heart gone clean
out o’ me. Ye see, my Rover wasn’t a water dog.
He jest nat’ally hated the water, but the big,
brave heart o’ him&mdash;&mdash;” Here the old man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
voice grew husky, while Don, wistfully watchful,
nestled close to him, looking up into his face with
a great longing to comfort expressed in his beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>“Aye, lad,” and the voice was still unsteady,
“aye, lad, ye have the look o’ my Rover!”</p>

<p>More than one of the boys dashed his hand
across his eyes as he looked at the lonely old
man with his arms around their Don’s neck.</p>

<p>In a moment Old Sam had pulled himself together,
and called to the boys to “fall to,” upon
which the boys brought forth their baskets and
promptly carried out Old Sam’s suggestion. They
avoided further mention of Rover, but their
thoughts were often drawn back to the tragedy
and in their hearts was a very tender spot for
Rover’s master.</p>

<p>After dinner they all set out for the quarries.
Sam, as he insisted upon the boys calling him, was
as good as his word, showing them a much shorter
road than the one they had intended to follow. In
a short time they reached the quarry, and found
they were in time to see some of the blasting done.</p>

<p>“Ye see,” Old Sam said, “owin’ to the late
spring, all the snakes hasn’t left their snug bedding
places in the rocks, but when the men comes
around with their blastin’ the durned reptiles
thinks it’s ’bout time fer them to be movin’. Ye
wouldn’t believe it,” he went on, “but some o’
them critters curls up in a great big bunch durin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the winter so’s they kin keep warm, and when they
gits their walkin’ papers, it’s as easy as rollin’
off a log to ketch ’em, they take so long to get
untangled.”</p>

<p>“But how do you catch them?” Jack had
asked eagerly. “Isn’t there great danger of your
being bitten?”</p>

<p>“Not much; ye have to be pow’ful keerful,
that’s all. Ye see, I gets behind one o’ them
snakes and sticks the two ends o’ this here pole
in the ground, one on one side o’ his neck jest
below the head, an’ the other on t’other side.
Then I stoops over and picks him up by the neck,
and drops him head first into this here leather
bag. Then when I gets him home, I kills him
and gets the ile.”</p>

<p>This interested the boys intensely, and they
could not wait to see it done. They stood awhile
watching the blasting when they had reached the
quarry, and then Old Sam suddenly cried out:
“See that? Look over there by them rocks! No,
this way! That’s right! Now d’ye see that reptile?
Come along, and I’ll show you how I kin
ketch ’em.”</p>

<p>Excitedly the boys followed Sam across the
rocks until he said, “Stay there! Don’t come a
step further. Now jest watch yer Uncle Sam!”</p>

<p>So saying, Old Sam was off down the rocks,
climbing as nimbly as a boy. With breathless interest
the boys watched as he drew near a snake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that lay basking in the sun. Without an instant’s
hesitation, he slipped up behind it, plunged his
pronged stick hard on the ground on either side
of its neck and, stooping over, picked it up quickly
just behind the head and threw it bodily into his
bag. Then, closing the bag tight, he clambered
up once more beside the admiring group of
Scouts.</p>

<p>“You sure are a wonder!” said Tom, and the
praise came from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d have the nerve to try that,”
said Tom Binns, who always had had a fear of
snakes.</p>

<p>“Waal, ’twan’t much to do,” Old Sam protested,
pleased beyond measure, nevertheless, by
the boys’ hearty and open admiration.</p>

<p>After they had examined the quarries thoroughly,
the party started out once more. When
they reached Sam’s cabin, he urged them to come
and see him often, to which the boys agreed
eagerly, and exacted a promise from him in
return that he would come and spend a day with
them in camp soon.</p>

<p>So, with a last gentle pat on Don’s head, Old
Sam watched the boys out of sight among the
trees, and then turned with a happy sigh to enter
his cabin.</p>

<p>“Them boys sure are fine lads, an’ the dog&mdash;waal,
he did have the looks o’ my Rover!”</p>

<p>The boys went happily along, talking about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
interesting events of the day, full of wonder at
Old Sam’s courage and skill.</p>

<p>That evening around the camp-fire, they told an
interested group of boys about the old snake
hunter. Tom Binns, who had been especially
interested in the story of Rover’s death, turned to
Don where he lay in his usual place beside Jack,
and whispered softly: “Don’t you go and get
drowned like poor old Rover, boy, ’cause if you
do, we sure would have to break camp! We can’t
get along without our mascot, old fellow!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="fs60">THE FIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As is usually the case with men who live close
to nature, the lumberjacks in Mr. Scott’s logging
camp possessed many rough virtues, and, it must
be confessed, some equally strong vices.</p>

<p>Among these might be numbered an inordinate
love of fighting. And fighting among these elemental
natures was not the honorable stand-up-and-fight-and-don’t-hit-a-man-when-he’s-down
style of combat that our Scouts were used
to considering it.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the one thing that the lumberman
desired was to put his opponent out of the
running, either by fair means or foul. And, indeed,
the tactics employed were considered all
right by their comrades, so in a way it could not
be said that they fought by underhand methods.
They knew what they had to expect, and so it was
“up to them” not to be taken unawares.</p>

<p>“Everything went,” no matter what it was.
A man might kick, bite, or gouge his adversary,
and if he tripped, might even jump on the fallen
man, without being criticized by his companions.
Just to win, in any way, was their one great aim
and object.</p>

<p>But if they had been allowed to follow their
tendencies unchecked there would have been little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
work done around the camp, as a large part of the
working force would have been disabled a good
part of the time.</p>

<p>To prevent this, the foreman, Flannigan, had
issued strict orders against fighting of any kind.</p>

<p>“The first one of yez that Oi catch at it, Oi’ll
lick meself, begorra, and fire him afterward,”
had been his ultimatum and the men, knowing him
for a famous “scrapper” and a man of his
word, had kept the peace up to today.</p>

<p>But there had always been a smouldering animosity
between two of the men and this morning
it threatened to burst forth into a “real knock-down
rumpus,” as the lumbermen described it.</p>

<p>The two lumberjacks in question were named
respectively Larry O’Brien and Jacques Lavine.
As may be inferred from the names, the former
was a strapping red-headed Irishman, with a big
bull neck and small, twinkling, blue eyes.</p>

<p>The Canadian, on the other hand, at first glance
seemed to be much the physical inferior of the
two. He was a lighter man and more slenderly
built, but from constant outdoor work his muscles
had become like steel wires. So that if the men
should at any time come to blows, as now seemed
very probable, they would be a pretty evenly
matched pair.</p>

<p>It was unusually hot weather, and that may
have had something to do with the ill-temper in
which the men found themselves. For another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
thing, work had been slack recently, and that is
always bad for men who are not used to it. Indeed,
the same thing may be said in regard to all
of us. The man who does not have to work
reasonably hard is to be pitied.</p>

<p>To cap the climax, the foreman was away on a
trip to the distant town for supplies, and this fact
further relaxed the reins of discipline.</p>

<p>If either of the two men had been called on to
give a reason for their hatred toward each other,
the chances are that they would have been hard
put to it to give an adequate reply.</p>

<p>Their feud had started in some little slighting
allusion to the other’s nationality, and small
things had led to larger, until now they both felt
that they must settle the question of supremacy
once for all.</p>

<p>As is commonly the case with those who are of
such an irritable and trouble-seeking nature, they
were really the two most worthless men in the
camp. They both drank heavily whenever they
got the chance, and were continually shirking
their work and picking quarrels.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that if they had put half as
much energy and time into their work as they did
into grumbling and quarreling, they would have
been valuable men.</p>

<p>Both were strong and skillful in the handling
of axes, and could bring a forest giant to the
ground as soon or sooner than anyone else in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
camp. It is too bad that in this world of ours
there is so much misdirected energy, which if
deflected into the proper channels would do so
much valuable work.</p>

<p>As has been said, on this particular morning
the men all felt out of sorts, and, to make things
worse, the cook had burned the biscuits.</p>

<p>“It’s always the way,” grumbled O’Brien, who
was usually called “Red,” both because of the
color of his hair, and also on account of his red-hot
temper, “them French cooks never is no
good, nohow! I for one never heard of a&mdash;&mdash; frog-eater
who ever was any good, anyhow,” he
continued, casting a meaning glance in Lavine’s
direction.</p>

<p>Lavine rose slowly from his seat, an ominous
scowl on his dark face.</p>

<p>“You mean to say, den, Irishman, zat you
tink no Frenchman be any good? Is zat what
you say?”</p>

<p>“Ye guessed right foist time, Frenchy,” replied
O’Brien, recklessly. “Now, what ye gonna
do about it, hey?”</p>

<p>“Dog!” hissed the Frenchman, his eyes flashing
and his dark face livid with rage. “I will
show you who ees your master!” and he leaped
across the rough table and struck O’Brien a tremendous
blow on the jaw.</p>

<p>Any ordinary man would have dropped like a
log, but the hardy Irishman only reeled a little
from the terrific buffet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>“So that’s how ye feel, is ut?” he grunted,
and they fell to belaboring each other in good
earnest.</p>

<p>The rest of the men were delighted at this turn
of affairs and quickly formed a ring around the
combatants.</p>

<p>Neither man was very popular in the camp, so
the men could enjoy the fight without having to
worry about which one conquered. All they cared
for was to see a rousing fight, and their desires
seemed in a fair way to be gratified.</p>

<p>Both men were in the pink of condition, and for
a long time neither seemed to gain any advantage
over the other.</p>

<p>They swayed backward and forward, exchanging
terrific blows that echoed on their chests like
the beating of a drum. No sound was heard save
their labored breathing and an occasional encouraging
cry from one of the men. It seemed as
though no man could live through such punishment,
and finally both were forced to rest through
sheer lack of wind.</p>

<p>Then they fell to again, and this time employed
all the rough-house tactics that they knew. Lavine
suddenly brought his spiked shoe down on
the Irishman’s foot with all the force at his command,
and the latter gave a bellow of pain and
rage. He retaliated by lowering his head and butting
it into the pit of Lavine’s stomach. The
Frenchman gave a gasp and reeled for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
but quickly recovered and returned to the attack
with tiger-like ferocity.</p>

<p>There is no telling how the fight would have
ended, for here there was a diversion. Flannigan,
the foreman, had returned to the camp after his
trip to town, and with one quick glance realized
what was going on.</p>

<p>With a yell he charged the group of men, who
made a path for him with rather sheepish looks
on their faces. He grabbed one by each shoulder
and threw them apart.</p>

<p>“Pfwat the Dickens do ye mean by this, ye
shpalpeens?” he shouted, angrily. “Didn’t Oi
say that Oi’d have no fighting in my camp? If
yez want to scrap, go and do it in some other
camp. Yez can’t do it here! Ye’re fired, both of
yez! Pick up yer duds and vamoose! Beat it now,
before Oi lick the two of yez! Get!”</p>

<p>The two men were entirely taken back by this,
for, as is usual with men of their type, they had
an exaggerated idea of their own importance and
had not believed that Flannigan would really discharge
them. When they realized that such was
actually the case, however, their first astonishment
changed to rage and resentment. Their
common plight caused them to forget their recent
quarrel and they were drawn together by their
natural grudge against Flannigan. They regarded
him with black scowls and then entered
the bunk house to get their things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“Who’d have thought the old cuss would take
it that way?” growled O’Brien.</p>

<p>“He’ll live long enough to regret it, by gar,”
snapped Lavine, grinding his teeth, “but not
much longer. No man can fire me, Jacques Lavine,
in dat way and live to boast about it. No,
sar!”</p>

<p>“We’ll get hunk on him, all right,” muttered
“Red.” “We’ll show him that he can’t get
away with anythin’ like that! Yes, by thunder,
we will!”</p>

<p>“Sure ting!” assented the Frenchman, and
the look in his eyes was not good to see. He was
the kind of man that would not stop at anything,
and it is safe to say that O’Brien would not be
far behind him in anything he might undertake.</p>

<p>The two worthies packed their blankets and,
after drawing the money due them, set out from
the camp. As they reached the edge of the clearing
they both looked back, and Lavine shook his
fist at the rough log houses.</p>

<p>“We’ll get square wiz ze whole bunch,” he
said, with a furious oath, “old Scott and all
of zem! Wait, dat’s all!”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Frenchy,” growled O’Brien.
“Shake on that,” and with black thoughts in
their hearts they entered the forest.</p>

<p>What plots they laid and how they failed to
take Jack Danby into the reckoning will be seen
a little later on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="fs60">THE BEAR’S SURPRISE PARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“And bang! bing! bang! went Billy’s gun, and
that was the end of <em>that</em> bear.”</p>

<p>The words came clearly, distinctly to Dick
Crawford swinging along through the cool, green,
glorious forest; but as he looked wonderingly
around, not a trace of the speaker could he see.</p>

<p>The words had been uttered in a clear, boyish
voice, but if a boy had been there, he must have
vanished into a hole in the ground, or been spirited
away by the woodland brownies, for no sign
of a boy could he see anywhere.</p>

<p>Dick stood perfectly still and listened with all
his might, but not a human sound could he hear.
Other sounds there were in plenty. The soft
gurgling of the little brook that wound down
the mountain side, and at its deepest part
the quick splash of an otter, as, his small head
glistening in the light, he swam rapidly across.
There was the low murmuring of countless insects,
the soft rustle of leaves as a frightened jack-rabbit
scurried to his burrow. In the branches
of a tree near by he could hear the twitter of a
mother bird as she fed her nestlings, and directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
over his head, in the spreading branches of a giant
oak, two squirrels scolded noisily, very noisily,
<em>too</em> noisily it all at once seemed to Dick, and, looking
up keenly into the branches over him, he said
quietly:</p>

<p>“A very good imitation of a squirrel, fellows!
The only fault with it is that it is <em>too</em> good, too
awfully good! Come down out of that, and give
an account of yourselves.”</p>

<p>At this there was a great commotion overhead,
and with, “Ain’t he smart?” “Too smart!”
“<em>Altogether</em> too smart for us,” a little group of
noisy Scouts slid recklessly down the scraggy
trunk of the old oak, and Dick was surrounded.</p>

<p>“We were some tired,” a Scout said to him,
“so we thought we would wait for you in the
tree. Just as you came in sight Bob was finishing
a most exciting bear story.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine and dandy up in that tree,” said
Tom. “Let’s go up again for a while.”</p>

<p>Dick looked doubtful, for their time was not
their own, and they must give an account of it to
the Scout-Master; but Jack told him that they had
really been working very hard for two hours, and
he thought a twenty minutes’ rest was what the
fellows needed. So as Dick gave the word, five
boys scrambled and climbed back like monkeys
into that tree before you could have said “Jack
Robinson!”</p>

<p>Comfortably settled, the talk went back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
all-absorbing topic they were discussing when
Dick arrived, and one of the fellows asked Jack
what he would do if he should stumble upon a
bear.</p>

<p>“If I were well armed,” said Jack, “and
knowing, as I do, how to shoot, I would face him
and defend myself. If I should meet him to-day,
I should race for the nearest hut or cave or anything
I could get behind or into, and thank fortune
that I was lucky enough to find such a
place.”</p>

<p>Some of the Scouts were inclined to think that
would be rather cowardly and were for taking
their chance of fighting with a club or anything
they could lay their hands upon. Jack gave them
a gentle reminder of Bruin’s by no means gentle
claws and his ferocious nature by running his
finger nails energetically down a Scout’s leggings
and uttering a most savage growl. At the
same moment Dick threw his arms around the
nearest fellow and gave him a genuine bear’s
hug till he begged for mercy.</p>

<p>After this demonstration, there was a general
coming round to Jack’s view. Some of the Scouts
hoped they <em>would</em> see a bear, and some hoped they
would not; but even those who hoped they would
felt way down in the bottom of their hearts that
they could manage to live without it. After all,
they hadn’t “lost any bear.”</p>

<p>Time was up now, so the Scouts slid nimbly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
back to solid ground, and they were off to
locate and make a list of the different trees. Already
that list was a creditable one, but they had
an hour yet to work before starting back to camp,
and they were anxious to make it long enough to
show to the Scout-Master with pride.</p>

<p>Aside from this desire, the trees themselves&mdash;the
great, noble, splendid trees&mdash;appealed to
them, and made the study of them an ever-increasing
delight.</p>

<p>They had located, marked and listed great
sturdy oaks towering seventy, eighty feet toward
the sky, and one old giant measured one hundred
and twenty feet in height. The Scouts felt very
small as they looked up with awe at the towering
branches of this monster tree.</p>

<p>Then there were beech trees, with their smooth,
ashy gray bark, about the same height as the oaks,
but not to be compared with them in usefulness,
although as firewood they are perfect, as are the
hickory trees. They (the hickory) and the chestnut
trees need no description. What boy does not
claim a close acquaintance with them?</p>

<p>Here rose a colony of butternut trees, not so
tall, but with large, beautiful leaves measuring
from fifteen to thirty inches in length, and the air
was redolent with the fragrance of pine and balsam
and hemlock.</p>

<p>From group to group of trees the Scouts went,
examining, studying, listing, so happily and thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
interested in this delightful work that
everyone started at a sudden cry of alarm in
Tom’s voice.</p>

<p>All turned, and at that moment saw the little
fellow run out from a clump of low bushes and
fairly flying toward them, call out bravely&mdash;not
“Help me!” but “Run, boys, run, run!
There is a bear coming!” and from the bushes
lumbered a bear, really of medium size, but looking
to the startled boys at that moment as big as
an elephant, and loped along only a few rods behind
Tom.</p>

<p>“The nearest tree and up it!” was their first
instinct, and Bob Hart and Harry French, who
were nearest to Tom, seized him by an arm on
either side and pushed and pulled him up with
them into the tree. The whole thing had been so
sudden and the scare so great that there had been
no time for sober thought, but only the blind instinct
to seek the first place of refuge. But just
as they were settling themselves in the spreading
branches, a thought occurred to Jack that made
his face whiten and his heart beat faster.</p>

<p>“Say, Dick,” he said, “we all forgot that a
bear could climb. We’ve done just exactly what
he wanted us to do!”</p>

<p>All the boys were seized with panic. Sure
enough, they were trapped. They were only boys,
after all, and face to face with a peril that might
well have struck terror to grown men; it is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
wonder that for a moment they were smitten
with panic.</p>

<p>The bear himself soon dispelled any doubt as
to his intentions and, swinging along heavily to
the foot of the tree, reared on his hind paws and
began to climb. There were no weapons in the
party, unless you could apply that term to the
small, light hatchets that they carried in their
belts. Even these were only toys against such
an enemy. One or two of the boys snatched at
them frantically and threw, but the branches of
the tree interfered with their aim and it was only
Dick’s hatchet that struck with its blunt end the
nose of the bear. Beyond a slight shake of the
head, he gave no sign of it hurting him, and steadily
kept on climbing.</p>

<p>The boys had pushed their way out along the
branches as far from the trunk as possible, and
just at this moment the branch on which Harry
French was moving suddenly cracked, broke, and
he found himself lying face down full length on
the ground about twenty feet from the foot of the
tree. The bear heard the crash and, seeing one
of his enemies thus delivered into his hands,
scrambled hastily back down the tree and started
toward Harry. There was only one thing for
the boy to do, and, being a Scout, he did it; he
lay perfectly still.</p>

<p>The bear, surprised at the quiet of the motionless
figure, hesitated just a moment, but that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
long enough for Jack Danby, who was perched
on a branch just overhead, to decide what to do.</p>

<p>His plan was only a forlorn hope and he knew
if it failed it probably meant the loss of his life
as well as Harry’s, but what could he do? “A
Scout is brave.” And he simply could not stay
there and see Harry, dear old Harry, attacked
without an effort at least being made to save him.</p>

<p>It was a time for desperate measures. With a
silent prayer for help, he jumped quickly and
landed, as he had schemed to do, squarely upon
the bear’s back. Now Jack was no featherweight.
Nearly nineteen years old, he was tall and well
developed, weighing much more than an ordinary
young fellow of his age.</p>

<p>The effect upon the bear was startling. When
this weight came crashing down upon him like a
thunderbolt, he was seized with consternation,
and, forgetting everything else in his panic, he
rushed away as fast as his legs could carry him,
and that was very fast, for, though a bear’s movements
give an impression of clumsiness, he can
move like a streak, as many a one has learned to
his cost when trying to escape. Jack, who had
rolled over and over, jumped up quickly and ran
to where Harry still lay, not daring to move. His
fall had shaken him badly, but no bones were
broken, although now that the danger was over
the terrific strain made him tremble like a leaf.</p>

<p>The Scouts had joyfully watched the bear out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of sight and, fearing that he might recover from
his fright and return, slid down the tree and
all started off thankfully for the camp.</p>

<p>Their path led along a natural hedge of high-growing
bushes, and suddenly they heard gruff
voices on the other side. They caught the name
of Flannigan, the foreman, coupled with an oath.
The words that followed halted them in their
tracks and they stood like statues.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="fs60">THE PLOT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Zen we shall knife heem&mdash;we shall keel
heem!” came over the hedge in accents undeniably
French.</p>

<p>“Naw!” was the reply, in a heavy brogue.
“We won’t kill him&mdash;that would be too aisy fur
him! He’ll sweat more if yer let him live. We’ll
do fur him! We’ll fix him so that it’ll be many
and many a long day before he’ll set foot to the
ground, and thin, begorra, mayhap wan foot will
be farther from the ground than the ither!”</p>

<p>The boys had no choice but to listen. Bob, who
was nearest the hedge, could look through a small
opening and plainly see the two ruffians seated on
the ground with heads close together in deep and
dark converse with each other.</p>

<p>They were an ill-assorted pair. Their different
nationality made them totally unlike in outward
appearance&mdash;one a great, ruddy, burly Irishman,
the other a slight, dark, wiry Frenchman. Utterly
opposed to each other by nature, their common
desire for vengeance had drawn them together
and, for the time being, made them pals.</p>

<p>At first, their one thought and desire was vengeance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
They had room in their angry hearts for
nothing else. Both were naturally cruel, and on
the day of their discharge they had shaken angry
fists at the camp, and through the days of idleness
that had followed they had thought only of
the punishment they would wreak on their enemy,
the foreman.</p>

<p>To waylay him in the woods, to get their eager
hands upon him, to beat him into pulp, and in the
end perhaps to take his life&mdash;this had been their
one object and aim.</p>

<p>But now a new element entered into their desire
for vengeance. For days after their discharge
they had roamed the woods. At first they had
made a visit to the county town, and there with
the reckless improvidence of their kind, had
feasted and drunk and gambled away every dollar
of their pay, drawn on that last day in camp, and
then had taken to the woods.</p>

<p>Since then they had lived on berries and roots,
and an occasional bird which they had managed
to snare. With a bent pin and a line made of
twisted fibers of long grass, and with worms for
bait, they had caught some fish, but their living
was scanty and poor.</p>

<p>Accustomed to the plain, but well cooked and
abundant food of the camp, days of this meagre
diet had told upon the two. Especially was it felt
by O’Brien, for his great, muscular frame needed
nourishing food, and food in plenty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p>While their tobacco lasted, it had not been so
bad, but as their hunger grew, their ferocity grew,
and, added to their desire to punish the man they
considered their enemy (it never occurred to them
that they were their own worst enemies) came a
determination to obtain money, no matter how.</p>

<p>Why should other people be sitting down three
times a day to tables loaded with things good to
eat and drink&mdash;the very thought made their
mouths water!&mdash;and lie down every night on
soft, comfortable beds, while they nearly starved
and slept on the hard ground at night?</p>

<p>The thought of Flannigan having plenty of food
and tobacco and all other needed comforts filled
them with ferocious rage and hate.</p>

<p>Money they <em>would</em> have, and mighty quick, too!
And a plan to obtain it had come to both men
at almost the same moment&mdash;Flannigan and the
payroll!</p>

<p>It was the custom of the foreman to take a
trip to the Junction, a station on the railroad
about ten miles from the logging camp, where the
station agent always had ready an express package
containing several thousand dollars, to be
used to pay off the men, and to defray the expenses
of the camp.</p>

<p>This trip was always taken on the last day of
the month, and now that was only five days away!</p>

<p>What a thought! What fools they had been
not to think of it before! To be able to get revenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and at the same time secure what was to
them a fortune, to revel and drink and gamble to
their heart’s desire!</p>

<p>“Be gobs!” said Larry, “that’s the finest
scheme that iver came down the pike!”</p>

<p>“It sure ees!” said the little Frenchman; and
then they fell to work in good earnest to arrange
their wicked plot.</p>

<p>“There’s only wan road back to camp, as yez
well know, Jacques, me mon,” said Larry, joyfully.
“An’ do yez moind the sharp turn in the
road about six miles this side o’ the Junction?”</p>

<p>“Oui, I know heem!” said Jacques.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the spot to do the job,” said
Larry. “If he wuz on foot, he might take the
short cut back to camp, but with the buggy, he
can’t hilp himself goin’ round by the road.”</p>

<p>“Dat ees goot; dat ees bien goot!” said the
little Frenchman. “Before he can say one petit
word, we will have heem by ze t’roat, and zen&mdash;” Here
Jacques, in an excess of fiendish exultation
at the thought of having his enemy at last in his
power, rolled over and over in the grass, and then,
springing to his feet, executed a series of clumsy
steps and only stopped when, his limbs failing
him, he dropped breathlessly to the ground, while
Larry sat grinning at his pal, fully sympathizing
with him in his delight at so soon realizing the
success of their scheme.</p>

<p>Again Jacques’ greed for the money gave place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to his hatred of Flannigan, and with darkening
face and cruel eyes, he raged:</p>

<p>“Chien! Pig! Dat he should tink to fire me,
<em>me</em>, Lavine, a son of ze great French republic, and
nevaire hear notink again!”</p>

<p>Larry waited a minute for him to calm down a
little, and then went on:</p>

<p>“Whin we have done fur him, we’ll divide the
long green aiven, and thin make thracks fur Canada.
Once in there, Jacques, me b’y, we’re outside
the United States, and they’ll not be able
to find us.</p>

<p>“Whin Flannigan comes around the turn of
the road, you go fur the horse’s head, and I’ll
tackle Flannigan. In wan minnit, before he knows
what’s happenin’, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just what more O’Brien might have said was
never known, for just then Don&mdash;blundering old
Don, seeing a jack-rabbit poke his head out from
behind the roots of a great tree, found the temptation
too strong to resist, gave chase and raced the
rabbit across the grass in full sight of the plotters.</p>

<p>The Scouts, who all this time had been standing
motionless, their hearts beating faster and
faster as the details of the plot were made plain
to them, and with faces on which horror was
clearly written, were filled with consternation at
this unexpected move of the dog. They now
quickly skirted the bushes and, slipping among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
some thickly growing trees, found a little bypath
and ran rapidly along it, on their way back to
camp.</p>

<p>As the big dog bounded after the rabbit and
into the bushes, within ten feet of them, the plotters
sprang to their feet, filled with alarm.</p>

<p>“Someone ees list’ning to our talk,” said
Jacques. “What ees eet that we shall do?”</p>

<p>“Look around and find them,” Larry replied.
“You look in the trees on that side, and Oi’ll
go over to that short cut thim Scout spalpeens
take to their camp.”</p>

<p>The two searched all around on both sides of
the hedge, but finding no trace of anything human,
returned to the scene of their conspiracy.</p>

<p>“But certainly there ees somebody has been
here, and he have hear what we have say,” said
Jacques, uneasily.</p>

<p>“If it was anybody, it, was thim B’y Scouts, bad
cess to thim!” grumbled Larry; and then, as if
thinking aloud, he went on:</p>

<p>“If it was thim measly Scouts, they’ll blab
from a ‘sinse of juty,’ as I heard wan of thim
say oncet, just as soon as they reach camp, and
the nixt thing they’ll do ‘from a sinse of juty’
will be to warn Flannigan. But let thim thry it!
Jist let thim thry it!” he sputtered, full of rage
at the thought that the Boy Scouts, whom he despised,
might, by warning the logging camp, be
the means of bringing to naught their carefully
thought out plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>“But zey shall not,” said Jacques. “We&mdash;you,
Larry O’Brien, and I, Jacques Lavine&mdash;<em>we</em>
will stop zem! Eet ees that we shall find a way.”</p>

<p>“We will that!” the Irishman said. “And Oi’ll
tell yez how we’ll do it. From the first minnit the
Scouts are out in the mornin’ till they are in camp
agin at noight, we’ll lie along the road to the loggin’
camp and watch, and the first Scout spalpeen
that shows his face anint it, we grab him. Oncet
we git our hands upon him, Oi’ll bet yez any
amount yez want that he’ll wish he’d niver been
born! His own mither won’t know him when she
sees him!”</p>

<p>“<em>Varmint!</em>” said the “son of the great
French republic.” “Zat makes me ver’ glad&mdash;ver’
happy! Zat ees what we shall do!”</p>

<p>So they talked; and, having arranged all to
their wicked satisfaction, went their way.</p>

<p>As soon as the Scouts reached camp, they made
a full report to the Scout-Master of their adventures.
When he heard the details of their encounter
with the bear, his hearty words of praise
for Jack’s heroic act found an echo in the heart of
every Scout in camp.</p>

<p>Jack modestly insisted that it was no more than
any Scout would have done if he had been given
the same opportunity. While the boys tried to
tell themselves that this was true, they admired
Jack none the less. They <em>might</em> have done it, but
Jack <em>had</em> done it, and that made all the difference
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>At the recital of the details of the plot against
Mr. Flannigan, the Scout-Master looked very
grave indeed. Knowing how unrestrained the
passions of the class of men employed at the logging
camp were, and how brutal and cruel they
could be, he fully realized Mr. Flannigan’s danger.</p>

<p>Of course, there was only one thing to do. He
must at once send a Scout to the logging camp
with a letter to the foreman, giving him full particulars
of the plot and warning him of his
danger.</p>

<p>So, intending to send Jack Danby and Tom
Binns immediately after breakfast the next morning,
he went to his tent to write the letter.</p>

<span class="fs60">TRAPPED IN THE CAVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Don opened his eyes, yawned, and then got up
from his comfortable bed, shaking himself and
stretching to his heart’s content. Trotting over
to Jack’s cot, he stood regarding his master,
doubtful whether or not to wake him. Finally
deciding that it must be time to get up, he stuck
his cold nose into Jack’s hand, and uttered his low,
good-morning bark, as Jack sleepily opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Time to get up, old fellow, is it?” he said,
pulling Don’s front paws up on his cot, while
Don’s plumy tail waved vigorously. “Well, I’m
not specially stuck on it, but ‘needs must when the&mdash;&mdash; ’”;
then, turning to Don, he said, reprovingly,
“You mustn’t say things like that, Don;
it’s not nice.”</p>

<p>Here Tom chimed in, saying with a stifled yawn,
“What time is it, anyway? It seems to me as if
I had just gone to bed, and here you are talking
about getting up!”</p>

<p>“Blame it on Don,” said Jack, cheerily. “He
woke me up, and he says it’s about time for us
lazy humans to be getting a move on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>“Well, of course, what Don says goes,” Tom
responded, caressingly pulling Don’s ear as the
dog went over to him, for Tom came second in
the big collie’s regard.</p>

<p>“Say, that was a narrow escape we had yesterday,
wasn’t it?” asked Tom, reverting to the
overheard plot of the day before. “There’s no
telling what those fellows would have done if they
had found out that we knew all about their plans
of revenge.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you suppose Mr. Durland will pick
out to go to the lumber camp to-day?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” Jack replied. “I’d
like nothing better than to go myself. After I’d
warned Mr. Flannigan of his danger, perhaps he
would show me around the camp. It would be
great fun, for I’ve always wanted to go over one
thoroughly, but have never had the chance. We
only got a glimpse of it the other day.”</p>

<p>“If you went, you could count on me to go, too,
and old Don, here&mdash;he’d never consent to being
left behind, would you, boy?” To which Don
promptly gave a decided negative.</p>

<p>Although the boys had been talking in whispers,
it was just enough to arouse the rest of the
Scouts, and in a twinkling the lodge was filled
with sleepy boys’ voices.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get up,” complained one.</p>

<p>“I don’t, either! Nothing would suit me better
than to stay just where I am for a couple of
hours!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>“I wish I could take a dip and lie in the sun
until I was dry, the way Don does. He never
has to bother with clothes.”</p>

<p>However, a Scout’s sense of duty is always
stronger than his love of ease, so in a few minutes
the boys all filed out to take their morning plunge.
It was only a few minutes until each Scout, refreshed
by a dip in the cold water, and filled
with the joy of living, rushed to the mess tent
and began his day in a way approved from the
beginning of time.</p>

<p>After the bedding had been aired and the cots
made up, the boys were called together by the
Scout-Master’s shrill whistle. They were then
divided into squads, and each squad was assigned
some special work for the day that was always
play to the wood-loving boys.</p>

<p>“I think,” Mr. Durland said, “that since Jack
knows the woods so thoroughly, he had better be
the one to warn Mr. Flannigan of the plot. I
suppose,” he added, turning to Jack, “that you
want Tom to go with you, as usual, and of course
Don couldn’t be kept in camp while you were out
of it. If I were you, boys, I’d start right away,
so that you can get back to camp early.”</p>

<p>With that the boys saluted, and with eager haste
went into the lodge to get their things ready for
the hike.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom! Come on, Don!” Jack
shouted a minute later as he led the way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the woods. “Let’s see how quickly we can get
to the lumber camp. Sure, we’ll break the record.
Ouch!” he exclaimed after a minute, turning
to look frowningly at the plant that had pricked
him.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that is, Jack?” he
asked. “I don’t remember ever studying a plant
like that.”</p>

<p>“Guess you don’t! That’s one of the plants
that grow near a bog&mdash;I forget the name of it
now. We’d better look out, though, if we’re anywhere
near a bog. I’m not over-anxious to take
a mud bath,” Jack replied.</p>

<p>“We’d be mighty lucky if we got off with nothing
worse than a mud bath. If we once got mired
in one of those swamps, the chances would be two
to one that we would never get out alive,” said
Tom, and then added suddenly: “Where’s
Don?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know!” said Jack, while his face
began to take on a worried expression. “He
can’t be very far off, though. He was here just
a minute ago. Here, Don; here, Don&mdash;where
are you, old fellow?” he called, but no joyous
bark answered the well-known voice.</p>

<p>Then Tom put two fingers between his teeth and
sent forth a shrill whistle that echoed and re-echoed
through the trees. This time, to their
great relief, they were answered, and in a moment
more Don himself came bounding up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
them. His relief showed in his voice as Jack
patted his favorite on the head and said, “We
thought you might be stuck in the swamp, Don.
Don’t go away like that again, will you, old fellow?”
And Don readily promised.</p>

<p>They started on again, this time with much
greater caution than before. Whenever they came
to ground that looked the least bit suspicious, they
skirted it very carefully. Don had kept close to
his master’s side as he had promised, although at
times it was very hard for him to keep from chasing
the squirrels and rabbits that looked at him
in such an aggravating way. Finally one reckless
little chipmunk scurried along almost under Don’s
nose, and it was more than dog nature could
stand. With a bound he was off after the little
fellow, who, frightened by the sudden onslaught,
fairly flew to the shelter of his hole and left Don
to bark away his vexation.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped barking and trotted forward
a few paces, then, with ears bent forward
and front paw raised, seemed to be listening intently.
Suddenly he burst into a chorus of wild
barks and then crouched down, growling savagely,
with his eyes fixed on a clump of bushes.</p>

<p>The boys, who were just rounding a rock and
could not see Don on ahead, started forward
eagerly to find the cause of his uneasiness, but
stopped abruptly as two men armed with heavy
clubs sprang out from the shelter of the bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
with the evident intention of doing for the dog
then and there. In a flash it came to Jack that
these were the two men whose plot they had overheard.
Suppose they had seen the Scouts the
day before and, taking it for granted they would
warn Flannigan, had lain in wait for them here
in this lonely spot?</p>

<p>As the boys were unarmed, discretion was the
better part of valor, so, calling to Don, they
doubled behind a couple of huge rocks and made
for a cave that they had come across on one of
their scouting expeditions a few days before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Don had sprung at the man nearest
him, who happened to be Lavine, and had caught
him by the leg. Lifting his cudgel high in the
air, the man would have felled him if he had not
heard Jack’s command to the dog to “come
along.” Quickly the dog dodged and started off
in the direction his master had taken. By that
time the second ex-lumberjack, O’Brien, had
caught sight of the boys and had started off hotly
in pursuit. Don knew that the boys’ safety depended
on the time they had to get away, so he
raced off after O’Brien. When he reached him,
he snapped at his legs and hands, while the man,
cursing and swearing horribly, aimed blow after
blow at his tormentor’s head. Dodging the blows
easily, Don watched the boys until they disappeared
through the trees.</p>

<p>As Lavine came running up&mdash;Don’s teeth had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
only gone through his trousers&mdash;the faithful dog
thought it was about time he left, so he made off
as fast as his legs could carry him in the direction
of the camp.</p>

<p>The cave that the boys were bound for had all
the characteristics of some wild animal’s home.
When the Scouts had come across it first they had
been impressed by the fetid odor that filled it and
the bones of small creatures that were strewn all
over the floor. Now, as the boys rushed along,
their one thought was whether or not the animal
would be there.</p>

<p>Running, slipping, sliding and stumbling, they
made their way down the steep ravine, dodged
behind a boulder and came in sight of the bushes
that hid the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>“Quick!” Jack hissed, pulling aside the
bushes. “I don’t think there’s anything in there,
but if there is, we’ll have to take our chance!”</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell, the boys were
inside and the bushes were once more in place.
With hearts threatening to jump out of their
mouths, they listened for the sound of footsteps
outside the cave. Pretty soon they came. Heavy,
ponderous footsteps they were, and they seemed
to be nearing the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>“I don’t see where the young deevils could have
gone,” they heard the Frenchman say, “yet zey
have disappear as if ze earth is open an’ swallow
zem up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>“I wish it had!” the Irishman replied, grimly.
“More be taken if Oi could oncet get ahold of the
spalpeens it wouldn’t be so very long before
they’d be kivered with airth.”</p>

<p>The boys shuddered as they thought of the murderous
attack they had so narrowly escaped, and
it was with a long sigh of relief that they finally
realized that their pursuers knew nothing of their
hiding-place. After a short time spent in fruitless
search, Lavine and O’Brien started off, grumbling
and cursing, to scour the surrounding woods.</p>

<p>The boys had been in as much apprehension
because of the possible return of the occupant of
the cave as they had been because of the presence
of the men. So now, when one danger was removed,
they had time to think of the other. As
soon as they thought the men were far enough
away for them to venture out, Tom, who was nearest
the opening, looked out to see if the way were
really clear.</p>

<p>He sprang back in alarm as a great pile of dirt
and stones came hurtling down the mountain side
with a roar like thunder and with a force that
made the ground tremble. The great mass was
piled high before the opening of the cave, shutting
out every vestige of light and air.</p>

<p>“Jack, Jack, where are you?” Tom called
wildly, groping around in the inky blackness for
his friend.</p>

<p>“Here, old man!” Jack replied from his corner.
“I thought from the roar a lion had come
to interview us. What has happened, anyway?”</p>

<p>“What has happened? Why, man, it seems
as if the whole mountain has slid down to cover
the cave. It’s shut out all the air, and we can’t
breathe very long with the little we have in here.
Why, Jack, do you realize that unless someone
finds us in a hurry we will die in this horrible
smelling hole like rats in a trap?”</p>

<p>“It sure is some tight place, old fellow, but
what we’ve got to do now is to brace up and
think of some way to get out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that sounds all right, but how are
we going to do it? Can we dig our way through
rocks and dirt with our fingers? Can we change
into moles and burrow our way out underground?
I tell you, Jack, we’re goners unless somebody
discovers us within the next hour at the most.”</p>

<p>“Tom, Tom, don’t talk like that! Brace up
and be a man! If we’ve got to face Death, let’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
meet him bravely, as a true Scout should. Besides,”
he added after a moment’s thought,
“don’t you remember the bones that we saw
scattered around here the other day? Let’s hunt
around and see if we can find some. They might
possibly help us to dig our way out.”</p>

<p>The boys searched desperately for a bone big
enough to be of service to them. Finally they
found a couple that they thought might serve
and they set to work fearfully to see what they
could do.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely they dug through the mass
of dirt and stones and they were just beginning
to hope that they might succeed when they received
an unexpected check. They had cleared
away a good part of the debris, but when they
started again after a moment’s rest they found
that they could go no farther, for the bones struck
upon a solid rock.</p>

<p>Mad with disappointment and rage, the boys
threw themselves upon the rock, tore at it with
their nails and struck at it with their bare hands
until they were all raw and bleeding. Finally,
exhausted and weakened by the lack of air, they
threw themselves, panting, on the ground where
they lay unable to move for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to recover himself and,
sitting up, he put his hand to his head, which
seemed to be whirling around dizzily, and said
sharply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>“Come, this will never do! Here when we
need what little brains we have, we use them
by acting like fools. If I could only think! If
I could&mdash;only&mdash;think,” he muttered, while his
head dropped wearily to his knee.</p>

<p>“Jack, Jack!” Tom cried, springing to his
feet. “I can’t stand it! I’ll go mad if I have
to stay here much longer! Can’t you hear the
birds singing out there? Can’t you hear the murmuring
of the brook? Can’t you smell the air
sweet with the glorious sunshine filtering through
the leaves and touching all the flowers with gold?
Why, man, the world’s alive out there, while in
here the darkness&mdash;awful darkness is bearing
me down, crushing me&mdash;” and with a shuddering
sob he sank down and buried his face in his hands,
trying to shut out that impenetrable wall that
seemed to be closing in upon him on all sides.</p>

<p>“Listen a minute, Tom, old friend, old comrade!”
Jack said gently, soothingly, reaching
over to put an arm about Tom’s shoulders. “We
forgot all about Don,&mdash;our Don who has never
failed any of us in a tight place. He must have
escaped from those lumbermen all right or they
would have said something about having done for
him when they came to look for us here. Well,
now, suppose he has escaped, what would he
naturally do first? Why, he’d go straight to the
camp of course and get the fellows here to help
us. If he did that, we may expect them any
time now. All we have to do is to wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>At Jack’s calm, matter-of-fact tone, Tom gathered
himself together and said frankly, “Jack,
you make me heartily ashamed of myself! From
now on I’ll try to act like a man and a Scout!”</p>

<p>So the boys, encouraged by the faint ray of
hope, sat side by side to wait for whatever might
be in store for them. Only once, as the air got
thicker and they found it harder to breathe, Tom
muttered, “I only hope they come soon!” And
with that they fell into a sort of stupor from
which they aroused themselves with great difficulty
from time to time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Don’s one thought and aim had been
to reach camp and bring help to his friends. At
first he had trouble in striking the trail and had
to go way back to the scene of the attack before
he finally found it. Then with nose to the ground
and with eyes that turned neither to the right
nor to the left, he trotted steadily along. There
was no rabbit in that whole wide expanse of forest
that could have tempted him to leave the trail
that day, for the well-being, perhaps the lives,
of his two best friends were at stake.</p>

<p>Once he lost the trail and for a few terrible
seconds ran about wildly in vain search of it.
Finally he picked it up again on the other side
of the brook and started on, faster than before
to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Another time a thorn stuck into his foot and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
although it hurt him cruelly, he never once
faltered or stopped, but only limped on unflinchingly.</p>

<p>Ay, Don, Old Sam spoke very truly when he
said, “Ye have the look o’ my Rover,” and he
might have added, “an’ the good, brave heart
o’ him, too!”</p>

<p>Although it seemed ages to the tired, lame dog,
it was in reality only a very short time before
he reached the camp. Luckily the boys had come
back from their scouting and were talking over
their various experiences. As the dog limped
painfully up to them Harry exclaimed, “Say,
fellows, what’s the matter with Don?”</p>

<p>“Looks as if he had something in his foot,”
Dick commented. “Come here, old fellow, and
let me see what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>Don came up willingly and held up his paw
to be examined. Impatiently he waited while
Dick, with many expressions of sympathy, took
out the long thorn and gently bound up the injured
paw.</p>

<p>“Poor old boy!” one of the Scouts said, as he
patted the dog’s shaggy head, “it must have
pained you terribly! But where are Jack and
Tom? It’s not like Jack to leave Don to come
on alone especially when he knew he was hurt,”
he added, turning to the boys.</p>

<p>At this Don, who had been waiting impatiently
while his foot was being doctored, ran to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
edge of the woods and stood there looking back
at the Scouts pleadingly.</p>

<p>“What does he want?” asked a Tenderfoot
Scout, who did not know Don as well as the
rest.</p>

<p>“He wants us to follow him. I’m afraid, fellows,
that something’s happened to Jack and
Tom. And I, for one, mean to find out what it
is and mighty quick, too!” said Pete Stubbs.</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” came a chorus of hearty
voices.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Durland had come up and
asked the cause of the excitement. He listened
to the recital of their fears with a very grave
face. In a moment the boys were flying around
everywhere to carry out his directions.</p>

<p>“Some of you boys go and get anything that
you can find in the lodge or out of it,” he said,
“to dig with. There are three or four old shovels
there that may come in handy and a lot of trowels
that we use for digging up specimens of flowers.
Hurry, boys!”</p>

<p>In a short time the Scouts were ready to start,
and Don, forgetting all about his sore foot, led
them rapidly along the trail.</p>

<p>Dick turned to Mr. Durland and asked him how
he meant to use the shovels.</p>

<p>“There is great danger in this part of the
country on account of the landslides that frequently
occur,” the Scout-Master explained. “Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
course, they are not usually on a very large scale.
They are very often caused by a loose rock starting
to fall from the top of a mountain and so
loosening masses of stones and dirt.”</p>

<p>“But do you suppose that the boys could
possibly be caught in one of them?” Dick asked,
while his face grew white at the very thought.</p>

<p>“There is a chance, of course,” Mr. Durland
replied anxiously, “and because of that chance,
I thought it was best to bring the shovels along.”</p>

<p>“Be prepared!” Dick murmured, and felt a
curious tightening of his heartstrings as he
thought of his comrades in distress.</p>

<p>Finally Don brought them to the clump of
bushes behind which O’Brien and Levine had
been hidden. The boys noticed how the ground
had been trampled down and the bushes torn
aside, and at once it flashed through their minds
that the boys might have been attacked. Here
Don seemed to lose the trail, but the Scouts now
readily picked it up, trained for trailing as they
were, and they started on again with redoubled
speed.</p>

<p>A dozen wild conjectures chased each other
through the boys’ bewildered heads. Suppose
the two lumbermen had learned of the boys’ intention
to warn Flannigan! Suppose they had
waylaid Jack and Tom! Would the boys stand
up to them? If they did, would they win? If
they had been attacked on their way to the lumber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
camp, every Scout felt sure that the boys would
do their best to avoid the plotters and deliver
their message. On the other hand, if they had
been coming back, it was more than likely that
the boys would stand up to the two ruffians. If
this last were so, what had been the outcome?
As nobody was able to answer this, all they could
do was to follow Don, now plunging on far ahead.</p>

<p>As they neared the cave some of the boys
recognized their surroundings. Then a new fear
came to torment them. What if the boys had
run to the cave for shelter and had found the
unknown inhabitants there?</p>

<p>In another minute they had scrambled down
the ravine, rounded the rocks and had come into
full view of the place where the cave had been.
At the sight that met their eyes they stopped
short and fairly gasped with astonishment and
dismay.</p>

<p>They all looked to Mr. Durland for an explanation
of this state of affairs.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said the Scout-Master in a strained,
unnatural voice, “you say that there was a cave
in the side of that mountain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Bob. “We examined it thoroughly
the other day.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid that you will all have a
chance to test every ounce of courage and fortitude
you possess to-day. Boys,” he said, and
his voice shook a little in spite of himself, “our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Tom and Jack are almost certainly in that cave
and are suffering&mdash;perhaps dying&mdash;for lack of
air! Are you ready, now, to get them out?”</p>

<p>The boys’ answer was a deafening shout, and,
snatching up their shovels and trowels, set to work
with a grim do-it-or-die expression on their young
faces that did Mr. Durland’s heart good. In
earnest they applied themselves to their heart-breaking
task, opening their lips for nothing except
to call the boys’ names from time to time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was that voice? It seemed so far away&mdash;as
if someone were calling from a great distance.
What was it they were saying? Was it
“Jack?” No, it was “Tom.” Why were they
calling them? Where were they? What was that
strange feeling in his head, that dizzy sensation,
that made him feel as if he were spinning around
and around? Had the lumbermen caught them
after all? No, that could not be it. Now he had
it! They were smothering to death in this loathsome
hole! So, by painful degrees, Jack drew
himself back from the dark abyss of oblivion and
came to a full realization of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Tom, Tom,” he cried, shaking his friend
fiercely, “they’ve come, they’ve come! Do you
hear them?” and he called out in as loud a voice
as he could again and again.</p>

<p>When Tom came to himself, he added his shouts
to Jack’s and they finally succeeded in making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
themselves heard by the straining workers outside.
With glad cries of encouragement, the
Scouts went to work once more with redoubled
energy. In five minutes, that seemed like five
ages to the gasping boys inside, a tiny place was
cleared before the entrance of the cave, letting
in a breath of cool, fresh air. In another half
hour the cave mouth was entirely free and the
two half-smothered boys were helped out by their
anxious friends. With a sharp cry Tom clapped
his hands over his eyes to keep out the dazzling
light.</p>

<p>The Scouts crowded eagerly about the two boys,
scarcely able to restrain their delight. They
patted them all over to see if there were any
broken bones, shook their hands and overwhelmed
them with questions.</p>

<p>Then it was Don’s turn. Limping from the
wound in his foot, he came slowly over the pile
of dirt and stones and looked wistfully up into
his master’s face.</p>

<p>“Don, darling old Don!” Jack cried, hiding
his face in the dog’s rough coat. “Then they
didn’t hurt you, beauty, did they?”</p>

<p>Then the boys learned all that Don had done
for them, and if they had loved him before, they
idolized him now.</p>

<p>Of course Jack and Tom were too exhausted
by their nerve-racking experience to continue
their journey to the lumber camp, so Mr. Durland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
chose Dick in their place, and with the good
wishes of the boys, he started off through the
trees.</p>

<p>On the way home, the boys could not hold their
wild spirits in check. They chased rabbits and
squirrels, shouted to each other, played leapfrog
and sang rollicking college songs. Only Don
walked soberly along beside Jack, too happy to
leave his master’s side, and his eyes alone told
a story more eloquent than words.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="fs60">DICK CRAWFORD GIVES WARNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was an ideal summer day, and Dick Crawford,
going through the woods toward the logging
camp, could not help thinking what a lucky fellow
he was.</p>

<p>“It’s worth a million,” he thought, “just to
be a Boy Scout, and to be alive on a day like
this.”</p>

<p>Dick was no poet, but if he had been, he could
have written an ode to the wonderful, mystic
forest. The narrow path he traversed was closely
hemmed in by giant trees, covered with moss and,
at times, he could see the glistening of a waxy
bunch of mistletoe high up on some old oak.</p>

<p>Finally his mind came around to all the exciting
events of the last few days, and he became
sober.</p>

<p>When would the miscreants be brought to book?
It did not seem possible that they could long
remain at large, but then the North Woods are
very extensive, and offer thousands of hiding
places to experienced woodsmen like the discharged
lumberjacks.</p>

<p>At this thought his heart sank, but Dick was
not one to worry much about things he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
not help, nor to cross a bridge until he came to
it.</p>

<p>So he dismissed all forebodings from his mind
and set up a shrill whistle that caused the forest
to echo and the squirrels to sit up in front of
the entrances to their homes and chatter angrily.</p>

<p>He looked upward toward the sun, which he
could at times glimpse through the thick foliage,
and, judging from its position that it must be
growing late, hurried his footsteps. He was soon
in sight of the camp, but could see no sign of
life about it. As he drew nearer the rough log
houses, he shouted, “Hello, there! Hello!
Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” responded a voice from the
cook’s house, and a moment later the tangled red
head belonging to the owner of the voice was
stuck out of the doorway.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Dick?” he continued in
a more friendly voice, as he recognized the Assistant
Scout-Master. “Well, what can I do you
for?”</p>

<p>Dick smiled at this characteristic question, and
replied, “Why, I wanted to see the foreman, Mr.
Flannigan. Where is he, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Search me!” replied Harry, with a careless
shrug of his shoulders. “But say, wait a
minute!” he exclaimed. “He did say something
about it, too. I remember now. He has gone
about fifty miles up north to look over a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
uncut timber land there, and I remember he said
he would be back before the last of this month.
But what did you want him for, anyway?” inquisitively.</p>

<p>Dick thought a minute, and then decided to tell
Harry all about the happenings of the last few
days. He knew that Harry was friendly to the
Scouts, and would help them all he could in
bringing the outlaws to justice.</p>

<p>Another thing that he did not know, but which
was an important factor in the chase later on, was
that Harry disliked the outlaws heartily. They
had often plagued him, and made his hard life
even harder, and he had often wanted to get
even with them. So it is possible that Dick could
not have taken a wiser course than that which he
now decided to pursue.</p>

<p>Accordingly he proceeded to detail the happenings
of the last few days to the attentive cookee,
who could not help interrupting him at times
with expressions of surprise and indignation.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” he
asked at the conclusion of Dick’s recital. “Ain’t
them two about the most underhanded crooks
goin’? I only hope I can do somethin’ to help
put them in jail,” and here the expression of
his eyes boded no good to the outlaws.</p>

<p>Dick perceived that he had gained an ally
worth having, and was pleased accordingly.</p>

<p>“I know that the others will be as pleased as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
I am to know that you are going to help all you
can,” Dick replied cordially to the other’s outburst.
“Now, Harry, you know from what I
have told you that both Lavine and O’Brien will
go to any lengths to get even with Flannigan, and
also with us, whom they now suspect to be their
enemies.</p>

<p>“We have reason to believe that they will do
all they can to waylay the foreman, steal the
money that he will have on his person, and either
kill or seriously injure him.</p>

<p>“Now, what we want you to do is to notify
us at our camp if the foreman is not back before
the last day of the month. Will you do
that?”</p>

<p>“Will I?” said Harry, his eyes sparkling as
he thought of the trust that was being placed in
him. “Well, I should smile! Just give me a
chance, that is all I ask. You can count on me,
Dick, as much as you can on yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I like to hear,” responded Dick,
heartily. “We’ll consider that settled, then.
And another thing, Harry, why on earth don’t
you join the Boy Scouts? You’d have no end
of fun, and we’d all be glad to have you.”</p>

<p>“Dick, all you fellers are bricks fur askin’ me,
but how can I? There ain’t anything I want as
much as to be a Scout, but I have no chance to
do what you fellers do. I got to work here from
the first streak of daylight, and quit when my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
work’s done, which is about ten o’clock every
night of the week. I am what you call a ‘kin
and can’t’ worker; I work as soon as I can see
and quit when it is so dark I can’t see.”</p>

<p>Here the boy tried to laugh, but the laugh
sounded strained somehow. It is very possible
that he felt more like crying than laughing, but
he would not have had Dick know it for anything.</p>

<p>Dick, however, knew boy nature pretty well,
and he guessed from Harry’s tone just about how
he actually felt. So he joined in the latter’s
laugh, and then said, “Now you see here, Harry,
old top, if you really want to be a Boy Scout,
there’s nothing on earth can stop you, and we’re
going to help you all we know how. I was speaking
to Mr. Durland about you the other day or,
rather, he was speaking to me, and he said that he
knew of a place that is open in Mr. Scott’s saw-mill
that he was sure he could get for you. That
would give you more money than you are making
now, I guess, and you’ll have a whole lot more
time to yourself. What do you say; would you
like to have that job?”</p>

<p>Harry’s eyes had filled in spite of himself while
Dick was talking, and now he said in a queer,
husky voice, “Say, Dick, would a duck swim?
All I can say is that you Scouts and your Scout-Master
are about the squarest, whitest bunch that
I ever run up against! I’ll beat it right along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
with you when you go back, and this job can go
to the dickens for all I care!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit,” exclaimed Dick, smiling at
the boy’s impulsiveness. “You can do us a
whole lot more good by sticking right here than
you could by being with us just now. We need
you here to tell us in case Flannigan doesn’t
get back on time.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d clean forgotten all about that,” said
Harry, ruefully. “But you’re dead right, and
no mistake! I’d be willing to stay here the next
ten years if it would help to catch them guys.
They’re pretty slick articles, though, don’t fool
yourself about that,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh, I realize that we will have our work
cut out for us,” responded Dick, seriously, “but
I think we can get them finally, just the same.”</p>

<p>“You bet your sweet life we can!” responded
Harry, enthusiastically. He had great confidence
in his new friends and felt that if anybody could,
they would be the ones to break up the plot. But
he was better acquainted with the rascals than
any of the Scouts, and knew that they were resourceful
and desperate men.</p>

<p>He was immensely proud of the trust placed
in him by Dick and the others, and resolved then
and there to show himself worthy of it. He had
always had a hard time of it, and had never
known what it meant to have a father or a mother.
He had earned his own living as long as he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
remember and that in a great city meant constant
and hard work. Then he had drifted north in
search of better paying work, and had finally
landed the job of cookee to the lumber camp.
There was more money in this than he had ever
made, although it was little enough, in all conscience,
but the work was terribly hard and exacting.</p>

<p>He was supposed to be the first one up in the
camp every morning, and on him devolved the
responsibility of arousing the sleeping men and
getting a good share of the breakfast. Then,
after each meal, there was the immense pile of
dishes to wash&mdash;a task which he hated with all
his heart. His work was ended only after everyone
else was asleep and he had rounded out the
last of his duties by setting the huge pot of beans
in the pit dug for it, there to simmer all night.</p>

<p>And it was not only the wearing work and
long hours that worried him and made him wish
more than once that he had never been born.
He lacked the comradeship of other boys of his
own age. He had always been too busy earning
a living in the city to mingle much with others,
and now, since coming to the lumber camp, there
had not been another boy within many miles of
him until the advent of the Scouts.</p>

<p>So is it any wonder that at the thought of
easier and more congenial work and more especially
at the prospect of having that companionship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
that his very soul craved, his heart
went out in gratitude to those responsible for
the change in his fortunes?</p>

<p>He felt that no sacrifice would have been too
great to make for them, and would willingly have
risked his life if he thought their welfare demanded
such a sacrifice.</p>

<p>So now when Dick held out his hand, and said,
“Well, so long, old man, until I see you again!”
his heart was running over with gratitude.</p>

<p>“So long!” responded Harry, shaking the
proffered hand fervently. “You can count on
me to the last gasp.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it, Harry,” and so with a last
word of farewell, Dick started on his homeward
journey.</p>

<p>He was very well satisfied with the result of
his mission, and was convinced that he had
gained a recruit worth having. In addition to
this he had formed a real liking for the cookee,
and was glad for his sake that things were to
be better for him in the future.</p>

<p>He felt, as many others have done, the force
of the fact that there is always a greater and
nobler pleasure in giving happiness to anyone
else than there is in securing it for oneself.</p>

<p>He swung along at a good gait, his mind busy
with these thoughts, and was somewhat startled
when, at a short turn in the path, he almost ran
into Bob Hart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, you gave me a scare!” he exclaimed,
after they had exchanged salutes. “What on
earth are you doing here, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s this way,” explained Bob. “You
know that we overheard what the outlaws said,
and after you had gone, Mr. Durland thought
that we had better patrol this path so that in
case either of them tried to stop you from going to
or coming from the logging camp, we could wig-wag
signals back to our camp, and so let them
know there what was going on. That is the solution
of the reason we are here.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could solve the mystery of why
those fellows aren’t in jail just as easily,” remarked
Dick.</p>

<p>“So do I!” returned Bob, soberly. “We seem
to be as far as ever from catching them, don’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Here, here, young fellow! That kind of talk
won’t do at all,” laughed Dick. “This isn’t
a case of where we <em>want</em> to catch them. It’s
a case of where we’ve simply <em>got</em> to. That’s
the only way to look at it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you’re right, Dick,” said Bob,
his confidence somewhat restored. “What did
Harry say? Is he going to join?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!” responded Dick,
cheerfully. “That boy is going to help us more
than a little, too. He knows a good deal about
the surrounding country, and he knows the habits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
of these rascals. He can figure out better than
we can, perhaps, just what they would be likely
to do under given conditions.”</p>

<p>As they had been holding this conversation, the
boys had been walking rapidly along, and now
they came up to one boy after another, all posted
as relays for wig-wagging.</p>

<p>Before very long they reached the camp itself,
and soon Dick was making his report to Scout-Master
Durland.</p>

<p>“So you see, sir,” he concluded, “Harry will
be a help to us, and we can help him, so it is
a sort of mutual benefit arrangement all around.”</p>

<p>“Which is just what the Boy Scouts are for,”
said Mr. Durland, smiling.</p>

<p>After a pause, he continued thoughtfully,
“Well, Dick, I guess we have done all we can
for the present, and now all we can do is to
keep a sharp lookout and see how events shape
themselves. Do you think of anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I can’t say I do. Not before Flannigan
gets back, anyway,” answered Dick respectfully,
and so matters were left, and the
Scouts settled down to a short spell of “having
a good time, doing nothing in particular,” as
Ben Hoover expressed it.</p>

<span class="fs60">“BUSY AS BEAVERS”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Come on, fellows,” said Jack, “let’s go and
take a swim.”</p>

<p>Dinner was over and the Scouts lay in various
attitudes on the grass a little distance from the
mess tent. The day had been unbearably hot.
Usually there was a breeze that somewhat tempered
the fierceness of the sun, and at night,
indeed, it was so cool that their blankets felt
mighty good.</p>

<p>This was the first really hot day that they had
had since they had pitched camp. They had
started out on a game of Mountain Scouting
during the morning, but Mr. Durland, who feared
the effects of the sun combined with violent exercise,
had limited the range of their run and they
had come home earlier than usual. Now nearly
an hour had elapsed since their dinner had been
eaten&mdash;or shall we say “gorged”? because with
appetites like theirs that was the most fitting
term,&mdash;and sufficient time had passed to make
the proposed swim a matter of no danger.</p>

<p>The boys greeted Jack’s suggestion with a
shout, and after obtaining Mr. Durland’s permission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
started off, running and leaping, kicking
up their heels like young colts, for the swimming
place a little way from camp.</p>

<p>It was an ideal spot. The brook, starting from
a point high up in the mountains and cold as
ice at the beginning, was gradually tempered as
it flowed under the sunlight into the lower levels
and in the meantime also widened its course. At
the point that the boys had chosen, it had spread
out into a small pond or lake perhaps three hundred
feet in width. Its course had also been
checked by the level nature of the bottom at that
point, so that it lay, with scarcely a perceptible
movement, gleaming in the sun, which warmed
it sufficiently to make swimming a delight. In
places it was only three or four feet deep, but
toward the southern end there was a depth of
eight or ten feet that made it suitable for diving.
The younger boys and those whose skill as
swimmers was not very great, chose the upper
part where, under the direction of Dick Crawford,
the Assistant Scout-Master, those unable to swim
rapidly learned, while those who simply knew
the breast stroke were taught one by one the
more scientific crawl and over-hand stroke that
are the envy and despair of the small boy when
he sees them put in practice by his larger companions.
Tom and Pete and Bob were down with
Jack at the southern end of the pool and as all
were expert swimmers and the bank was within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
easy reach, to say nothing of the assistance that
would be instantly rendered by any of their companions,
should ill luck befall, were left to do
as they liked.</p>

<p>They had found a heavy plank a few yards distant
from the bank and had placed it over the
log of a fallen tree so that it rose at a gradual
angle until, where it overhung the stream, it
was about ten feet from the water. The end
that rested on the ground was firmly wedged
between heavy rocks that the boys had gathered,
capped by a section of tree trunk, so that, no
matter what might be the strain at the other end,
it was impossible for it to slip or yield. It made
a capital springboard and the Scouts had a
glorious time playing follow my leader. The
slope of the plank was so gradual that they got
a good running start, and, reaching the end of
the plank, with hands upraised over their heads,
were flung out in a graceful curve coming down
head foremost, straight as an arrow, and seeing
how far they could swim under water before the
need of breath compelled them to come to the
surface.</p>

<p>Jack’s familiarity with woodcraft and the
lonely life of his early boyhood when he was
left so largely to his own devices and to what
enjoyment he could procure unaided from nature
had made him a splendid swimmer. He could
dive forward and backward. He could sit at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
end of the springboard and from a sitting position
leap to his feet on the edge of the board
and dive into the water with just one motion.
Once in the water, he swam like a fish. He could
float and on occasion had done so for an hour at
a time without changing his position. His action
in swimming was grace itself. Now after the
boys were tired of sporting in the water, he
pressed his hands close against his side and swam
from one end of the pool to the other, using
simply his feet.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Tom, who had never seen Jack
swim this way before, “where did you learn that
stroke, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jack carelessly, “I got that from
the beavers.”</p>

<p>“Beavers?” said Pete, with interest. “Do
they swim that way?</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Jack. “Their front paws are
very small and they have to rely entirely upon
the back ones. These are webbed like those of a
duck up to the root of the nails, and it’s one
of the prettiest things you ever saw to see a
beaver swim. There is scarcely a ripple. The
front feet are perfectly motionless, pressed close
up against its side, while its head, with its shining
fur and its keen, bright eyes that seem to look
in every direction at once, moves in a perfectly
straight line toward the front door of his house.”</p>

<p>“House?” said Tom, incredulously. “What
do you mean by that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>“Just exactly what I say,” said Jack.
“Haven’t you ever heard of beavers’ houses?
Why, there isn’t a more intelligent builder among
all the animals I know about, and I’ve watched
almost every one of them! It’s not only a big
house, but a well-made one. The beaver is never
satisfied with anything but perfection. It has
a lot of rooms in it and these are carpeted with
leaves and moss and grass. The upper rooms
are sometimes six or eight feet above the surface
of the water so as to be perfectly dry. The wise
old rascal knows that sometimes there is a freshet
that raises the level of the stream and he makes
his plan accordingly. There isn’t a thing about
carpentering or mason work that he doesn’t know.
And he has to make his house strong, too, because
he has a good many enemies. The wolves and
wolverines are after him all the time and unless
he had something that they could not bite through
or claw through, it would be all up with Mr.
Beaver.”</p>

<p>By this time all the boys had become interested
in Jack’s description and had gathered around
him.</p>

<p>“You’re a lucky dog, Jack,” said Bob.
“You’ve seen a whole lot of things that us city
fellows don’t know anything about.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, “there is no reason why
you shouldn’t find out all about the beaver, because
I know for a fact that there are some not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
far from camp. Just the other day I caught sight
of a beaver dam about three miles the other side
of the logging camp. I was going to speak to
you fellows about it at the time, but Don just
then started up a woodchuck and we all got so
excited that I forgot. What do you say to dressing
and going over there now? It won’t be so much
of a hike and as the camp is on our way, we will
drop in and ask Mr. Durland about it so that
he won’t be worried if we don’t get back until
just before supper time. There is nothing else
on hand for this afternoon and I am mighty sure
that he will let us go. Wouldn’t be a bit surprised
if he wanted to come along with us!”</p>

<p>The plan was greeted enthusiastically and after
the fellows at the other end of the pool had been
told about it, they rushed out and dressed quite as
quickly as the rest. Then they hiked back to camp
and put the matter before the Scout-Master, who
readily assented to the trip, and, as Jack had
foreseen, was very glad to go along. After a
little more than an hour’s tramp Jack held up
his hand in caution.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be careful now, Scouts,” he
said. “They’re wary old fellows and the least
thing disturbs them. If they once suspect that
we are anywhere near, it’s good-night with us.
Those big, bright eyes will see us all right but
we won’t catch a glimpse of them. Now’s the
time for you Scouts to show what you know of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
woodcraft and follow me as silently as a band
of Indians.”</p>

<p>Thus cautioned, the boys fell in behind Jack
and, carefully avoiding stepping upon twigs or
speaking above a whisper, soon reached the dam.
They were on the banks of a mountain stream that
wound its way through the woods until at the
point where they stood it was perhaps a hundred
feet in width. Just below them the progress
of the stream had been checked by what seemed
at first sight a narrow bridge extending from one
bank to the other. This was about three feet
wide and perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>As Jack whispered to Dick, who was the nearest,
this was made just wide enough so that the beavers
in going to and fro could pass each other
in comfort.</p>

<p>It evidently grew a great deal thicker as it
approached the surface of the water and at the
lowest part was probably ten or twelve feet thick.
As the current was not especially strong, this
served effectually to make an almost unrippled
pond such as the beavers love. It was not exactly
straight across but bent in slightly on the
side that pointed up stream so that at the center
it was decidedly curved.</p>

<p>This, as Jack further whispered, was to break
the force of the current and shunt it off gradually
to each side of the dam.</p>

<p>It was the same principle that in a racing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
automobile gives the cigar-like point to the machine
so as to act as a wedge going into the wind
and lessening by that much its resistance. The
base of the dam was formed by young saplings
and branches of trees that had been cut by the
beavers’ teeth and planted as piles. Between
these they had woven blades of grass and strips
of bark so as to hold the branches straight and
form a foundation for the mason work that was
coming next. For the wise little creatures knew
perfectly well the force of the current, and were
determined to make a good job while they were
at it. They had made mortar from the gravel
and clay on the bank of the stream, using their
broad, flat tails as a trowel for mixing. They must
have had to travel to and fro thousands of
times before they completed the work and built
around their temporary outlines of plaited
branches the solid wall of masonry. They knew
enough also not to make it top-heavy, and so
gradually sloped it from the bottom to the top,
making it more compact by slapping it with their
tails until at last it stood almost like a wall of
granite. They watched over the dam day and
night. No Hollander was ever more careful to
prevent a leak in the dikes than they were to
keep their dam perfectly solid. They knew that
a little carelessness at the start might spoil the
work of years.</p>

<p>While the boys were looking open-eyed at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
specimen of the beavers’ work, Jack suddenly
whispered, “’Sh, here they come! Now keep
perfectly still, boys, and you will see something
worth while.”</p>

<p>From one of the mound-like houses up the
stream a large beaver came out, slowly looking
around him with infinite caution before he left
the safety of his home. He was about two feet
long in addition to a flat oval tail that made his
total length nearly three feet. His nose was
blunt, his ears small, and his eyes wonderfully
soft and intelligent. He carefully scanned the
banks and the surface of the stream, and, satisfied
at length, paddled slowly toward the dam. Something
in its appearance must have alarmed him,
for suddenly he lifted his tail and struck it several
times against the side of the dam. At the sound,
as though it were a signal, two or three other
beavers emerged from their houses and rapidly
joined him. They swam toward a point on the
farther side, where the boys, now that their attention
was attracted to it, could see that a little
stream was trickling through and falling to the
lower level of the creek beyond.</p>

<p>In an instant all was activity, although there
was no confusion. They acted as though they
were perfectly disciplined and each knew just
what he had to do. Two of them swam to the
farther bank, climbed up and began to tear with
their sharp teeth at some slender saplings. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
was astonishing to see how quickly they had
gnawed their way through and how adroitly they
moved to one side when it fell. These they
dragged to the edge of the bank, plunged into
the water, holding an end in their teeth, and
swam quickly toward the threatened point. Then
two or three of them got together and pushed
the young branches in among the others. One
of them in the meantime had taken up his position
on the bank and was rapidly making mortar,
doing it as skillfully as the most experienced
mason, pounding the clay and mud and stones
together until it reached an even consistency and
at times flirting water upon it with his tail. Then
gathering up as much as he could carry between
his two front paws and chin and with head held
well out of the water he swam to the others, just
as Jack had said, using his hind feet alone.
There he dropped his load and returned for another.</p>

<p>By this time the others had done whatever
work was necessary with the branches, and all
devoted themselves to the mortar, working with
incredible rapidity and never stopping for a
moment. How long it would have taken to complete
the repairs the boys never knew, for at
that moment Tom, who in his eagerness had
bent forward, lost his balance and fell with a
crash to the ground. The wary creatures heard
him instantly and like a flash turned and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
for their homes. A moment after the surface
of the water was as smooth as a mill-pond and
none would have dreamed of the life and activity
of a moment before.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bob Hart, angrily, “of all the
bone-heads!”</p>

<p>“Bone-head yourself!” said Tom. “How
could I help it? Do you suppose I fell on purpose?”</p>

<p>“Come, come, boys!” said Mr. Durland.
“We all know it was an accident and nobody
is more sorry than Tom himself. But I guess
there is no use waiting here any longer. You can
be perfectly sure that there will be nothing doing
now for the rest of the day.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and the others followed
toward the camp, so full of wonder and excitement
at what they had seen that it completely
overshadowed their chagrin at Tom’s carelessness,
and he got off more easily than he had expected.</p>

<p>All that evening when supper was over and
cleared away the boys were so full of the events
of the afternoon that they could hardly think
of anything else.</p>

<p>“My,” said Bob, “did you see that beaver’s
teeth? I’d hate to have him bite me!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, “they wouldn’t bite you
unless they were cornered and had to. Then it
would be a pretty healthy thing to keep out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
reach of their teeth. They are as sharp as a
chisel. As a matter of fact, the Indians use them
to carve out their ornaments of bone. The beavers
use them so much that Nature has to keep hustling
to supply new material. There is an outside row
that projects toward the front and an inner row
that furnishes the material to keep the outer ones
strong and keen. Sometimes a beaver loses a
tooth on either the upper or lower jaw and then
the one directly opposite this keeps growing so
fast that after a while it prevents the beaver
from closing his mouth. He can’t eat and soon
starves to death.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Dick, “if that was a whole
family that we saw this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I think very likely,” returned Jack, “because
if there had been more they certainly would
have been on the job. The beaver is a sociable
animal and never cares to live alone. Usually
there are four or five found together, but sometimes
as many as thirty or forty will gather in
a little village of their own. Each family has
a separate house and each member of the family
has his own individual room, which he keeps
jealously for himself, and there is always a scrap
if any one else tries to bunk in there with him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you find them almost everywhere,”
said Bob Hart.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” said Jack. “They used to
be very plentiful, but their fur is in such great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
demand that hunters and trappers are after them
all the time. In Europe, where they used to be
abundant, there are hardly any left except in the
zoos as curiosities. You don’t find so many of
them in America either now, except where it’s
cool, as it is up here, and over the line in Canada.”</p>

<p>“Well,” yawned Tom, as they finally got ready
to go to bed, “I’d hate to have to work as they
do. Did you see how they pitched in this afternoon?
It makes me tired even to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack. “I guess we all know
better than ever before what it means to be as
‘busy as a beaver.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“‘Where are you going, my pretty maid?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m going a-milking, sir, she said,’”
chanted Pete as Ben Hoover emerged from the
mess tent with the largest tin pail the camp
boasted swinging from one hand, and the next
largest one from the other.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Ben, with mock dignity,
“I’m not in the humor even to resent the insult
your words imply further than to say that you
will be sorry for those cruel words when you
learn my mission.</p>

<p>“I am about to sacrifice myself on the altar
of friendship! I am about to separate myself
from human society for the space of two endless
hours! I am to spend those two hours in gathering
material for raspberry dumplings”&mdash;here a
general shout of delight greeted him&mdash;“with
which to brighten the lives of many friends.”</p>

<p>This speech was highly applauded by the
“many friends,” and Ben, bowing solemnly,
picked up his two pails and walked off, followed
by cries of:</p>

<p>“Hurrah for friendship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p>“Bully for you!”</p>

<p>“Go in and win!”</p>

<p>“We won’t do a thing to those raspberries!”</p>

<p>“Wait till you get them,” Ben called back, as
he disappeared down the hill.</p>

<p>Whistling gaily, Ben swung along till he came
to the spot he had noticed the afternoon before,
where the raspberry bushes glowed red with the
luscious fruit.</p>

<p>By the time he had filled one pail, the berries
were getting more scarce, and he wandered on in
search of the best filled bushes.</p>

<p>He did not notice that the ground was growing
soft and springy under his feet. He only
thought of getting that other pail filled and hiking
back to camp in time for the cook to use
the berries for those promised dumplings.</p>

<p>“Ah, there is the dandiest one yet!” he said
to himself, as a bush fairly loaded with the red
berries met his sight. He set down his pail and
reached for the berries. At that moment a sensation
came over him as if the ground were giving
way beneath his feet, and without a moment’s
warning he found himself ankle deep in soft,
sticky mud.</p>

<p>Not in the least alarmed, he tried to spring to
firmer ground, but instead sank deeper into the
mud than before.</p>

<p>More vexed than frightened, he made a more
determined effort to draw one foot out, but found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
that he only sank deeper. In sudden anger, he
struggled fiercely. What a sight he would be
to return to camp with his clothes all covered
with mud! And such mud! How he loathed it!
He <em>must</em>, he <em>would</em> get out, and again he tried,
leaning from side to side, tugging first at one foot,
then at the other, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Thoroughly frightened now, and filled with
panic, he threw himself first backward, then forward,
to left, to right. Desperately, wildly, he
strove to draw himself from that awful bog. It
seemed as if some terrible monster with countless
hands were dragging him down, deeper, deeper
into that awful mire. The more he struggled, the
deeper he sank.</p>

<p>All at once he realized this and ceased to struggle.
He tried to think. Was it possible that there
was no way to get out of this all-enveloping mud?
Could it be that he was to die here, all alone?
And such a terrible death!</p>

<p>The thought sent a shudder through him, and
for a few moments he felt faint and ill. But no,
it could not be! Why, his life was just begun!
What about all those plans to make the most of
every ounce of ability God had given him, to make
a successful man of himself, to help others, to
make this old world some better because he had
lived? Why, he <em>could</em> not die, he <em>could</em> not! He
had too much work to do first!</p>

<p>He thought of the merry words that had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
between him and his fellow Scouts only a short
hour before. How full of life he had been! Why,
he was as full of life now! Nothing had changed!
The sun shone warm upon his upturned face, the
air was sweet with the smell of growing things.
A brilliant butterfly settled for a brief moment
on his motionless hand, fluttered, and flew away.
A bird rose from a tree, and, spreading light
wings, was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>How he envied that bird! It was free, while he,
worth countless birds, was held here, where, if
help did not come to him soon, he must die. His
boy heart was filled with despair.</p>

<p>But no, he would not despair! He must think
of some way to help himself. There must be some
way! Some of the Scouts must be near.</p>

<p>He called again and again, but no answer came
back to his straining ears. He kept his face
toward the sky, for he did not dare look down at
that terrible mud, but yet he knew that he was
sinking, slowly, steadily. He could feel that the
muck was half way between his knees and his
waist.</p>

<p>If he could only get someone to help him! If
he could only make someone hear! If he only had
something&mdash;ah, a sudden thought sent such a
thrill of hope through his heart that it fairly hurt.</p>

<p>His whistle&mdash;his Scout’s whistle! Why could
he not signal with it? He, like all other Boy
Scouts, was familiar with the American Morse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
telegraph alphabet. He would try and, placing
the whistle to his lips, he sent out in shrill notes
his call for help.</p>

<p>Bob Hart, like Ben Hoover, was on the commissary
staff that day, and was fishing for a mess
of trout for dinner in the brook about a quarter
of a mile from the bog.</p>

<p>Pausing to take breath, after a particularly
fine fish had been landed, he wondered what that
queer whistle was that came faintly, yet insistently
to his ears. Was it some bird he had never
seen or heard until then? Well, it was a queer,
jerky note, anyway.</p>

<p>All at once there was something in that whistle
that made him drop pole and line, and stand listening
not only with all his ears, but with all his
heart.</p>

<p>There was something familiar about it. What
was it? Ah, now he knew! It was a signal&mdash;a
message in the Morse alphabet, and again he listened
intently.</p>

<p>Two short, sharp whistles&mdash;that was <em>I</em>. One
long-drawn, and then a short whistle&mdash;that was
<em>in</em>. Then in quick succession the other letters
of the message, <em>In the bog. Help me. Hurry.</em></p>

<p>Every nerve in Bob’s alert young body responded
to that pitiful call. He ran&mdash;he raced&mdash;he
flew, while always came that cry, “Hurry!
Hurry!” faint at first, but louder as he neared
the bog. It seemed as if his feet were held down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
with leaden weights. Why could he not go faster?
In his eager heart the wish was repeated again
and again, Oh, if he only had wings!</p>

<p>On, on he sped, and nearer and more insistently
came the call, “Hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>Now perhaps he was near enough to call
and, raising his clear voice, he shouted, “Courage!
I’m coming! I’m coming!” and sweeter
than angel music the words sounded to Ben
Hoover, sunken now to his waist.</p>

<p>A moment more, and Bob was there, encouraging
him and promising to have him out in a jiffy,
but this was far more easily said than done. To
find something he could throw to Ben that would
serve to keep him from sinking farther&mdash;that
was the first thing. After that he would think
of something to do to draw him out.</p>

<p>He pulled some bushes up by the roots and, as
he threw them, told Ben to push them close up
against him and rest his arms upon them. He
felt sure they would keep Ben from sinking
deeper. They did help, and for a moment both
Scouts thought their problem solved and they
chatted hopefully of the help that Bob was to
bring. Vain hope! Suddenly the bushes sank
from view, and in the suction they caused poor
Ben sank lower.</p>

<p>Quickly Bob ran back and forth, searching desperately
for something to throw to his unfortunate
comrade. A sapling! A board! Oh, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
he had a board! And as if a miracle, he caught
sight of a long one lying among the trees. How
it came there he did not know or care. That it
was there was enough. He ran to it, snatched it
up and, running to the edge of the bog, slid it
carefully along until it was within Ben’s reach.</p>

<p>Carefully, wise now to the fact that the slightest
movement made him sink deeper, Ben drew
the board in front of him.</p>

<p>“Don’t bear your full weight upon it,” counselled
Bob. “If you just press upon it lightly
with your hands, perhaps it will hold you.”</p>

<p>Poor Ben, eager to do every slightest thing to
help himself, obeyed and, as the board did not
seem to sink, again hope sprang up in their
hearts.</p>

<p>Bob wanted to go at once for the desperately
needed help, but Ben, terrified at the thought of
being left alone, begged him to wait a few minutes
until they were sure the board would hold
him up until Bob could go and return.</p>

<p>“Keep up your courage, old man,” said Bob.
“If that board holds&mdash;and I feel sure it will&mdash;we’ll
be all right. I’ll do a regular Marathon up
to camp. Harry and Pete are cooks this week, you
know. They will come back with me, and we’ll
bring everything we can lay our hands on to help.
It will be mighty strange if we three husky fellows
can’t get one boy out of a fix! So you just
be gay thinking about it, old fellow. We’ll have
you out before you know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>As he finished speaking, Bob arose and with a
last wave of encouragement to poor Ben, he
started on a run for camp. But that Marathon
was never run.</p>

<p>Hardly had Bob gone a hundred yards from
the bog than he heard Ben’s imploring voice calling,
“Come back, Bob! Come back! The board
is beginning to sink!”</p>

<p>Bob came tearing back in answer to that pitiful
summons to find that in truth the board was
sinking a little in the mud. Beginning at the
heavier end, it slowly sank out of sight, and as
it disappeared drew the boy a little farther down.</p>

<p>He had now sunk halfway between the waist
and shoulders. Now, indeed, did both Scouts
begin to despair. Half-crazed, Bob ran wildly up
and down, whistling shrilly, frantically searching
for something with which to aid his comrade.</p>

<p>There was nothing! He could do no more!</p>

<p>He stood, outwardly calm, but with his heart
dying within him as he watched Ben’s efforts to
be brave as his last hope vanished.</p>

<p>“That’s right, dear old fellow,” said Bob,
“keep up a brave heart! I’m sure that help will
come! I’m sure! Oh, Ben, if we only had a
rope!”</p>

<span class="fs60">OLD SAM TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As Bob stood there, desperately casting about
in his mind for some way to help poor Ben, now
up to his armpits in the black mud, he heard, or
fancied he heard, a twig snap in the forest. Did
that sound exist only in his imagination, or had
he really heard it? While he was still in doubt,
the underbrush parted, and he saw the best sight
in the world for him just then. There, framed
by the bushes, was the picturesque figure of Old
Sam, the snake hunter, and in his hand he held
his two-pronged snake pole.</p>

<p>At a glance he took in the situation and, springing
forward lightly, extended the pole to Ben.</p>

<p>“Ketch a hold o’ the pole, an’ hang on to it,
lad, an’ I’ll pull ye out! Got a good grip? That’s
right&mdash;now steady! Never mind! Ye’ll keep
it next time,” as the pole slipped from Ben’s
nerveless fingers, and let him down a little deeper
in the muck.</p>

<p>“Here, lad,” he said to Bob, “ketch on to this
here and help me pull!” Then encouragingly to
Ben, “Now ye got it? Hang on tight this time!
Good boy! Now once more&mdash;steady&mdash;steady!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Ye’re comin’, boy, ye’re comin’! Hang on another
minnit and ye’ll be on solid groun’! Steady!
Now&mdash;steady! There ye be!” he cried, exultingly,
as they landed poor Ben, mud from head to
foot, on the soft, dry grass, where he lay exhausted.</p>

<p>“It’s durn good I happened ’long jest as I
did,” Old Sam hurried on to keep the boys from
thanking him. “I nearly turned down t’other
road for the village, but I sez to myself, ‘Sam,
old boy, p’raps ye may meet some o’ them camp
boys if ye goes by this here road,’ and so jest on
the chanct o’ meetin’ ye, I come this way. I never
reckoned I’d meet ye the way I done, though,”
he added, chuckling to himself.</p>

<p>Here Ben, who had been trying desperately
during this monologue to get a word in, thanked
the old man heartily for the great service he had
done him.</p>

<p>“I surely would have gone under in another
minute if you hadn’t come along!” he said. “I
never was so glad of anything in my life as I
was to see you standing there with your long
pole. I really don’t know how to thank you!”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said old Sam, who always hated
to be thanked for his kind deeds. “’Twan’t
nothin’ ’t all! No more’n any Christian would
hev done ef he’d found a friend o’ his’n in a tight
place. I reckon ye must feel durned sticky with
that there mud all over ye, lad,” he added, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
change the subject. “S’pose ye come up to my
cabin&mdash;’taint so very far from here, and scrape
some o’ it off.”</p>

<p>The boys readily consented, for they had
learned to think a lot of this quaint old man of
the woods. Therefore, as soon as Ben had recovered
his strength and felt rested enough, the three
started out for Sam’s cabin. In a very short
time they came upon the little place nestling in
the very heart of the forest.</p>

<p>Sam told Bob to make himself comfortable
while he took Ben around to a brook that ran
back of the cabin and told him that if he wanted
to take a plunge, he (Sam) would scrape the
muck off his suit. And soon Ben, wonderfully
refreshed by his dip in the cold water, and wearing
his khaki suit, from which Old Sam had
scraped the worst of the mud, came around the
corner of the cabin and joined Bob.</p>

<p>The two Scouts were in a very subdued mood.
The terrible experience they had just passed
through brought with it a reaction. There was
something very restful and soothing in sitting
on the grass, with their backs against a log, while
Old Sam moved cheerily around inside the little
cabin, frying bacon and eggs.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, Sam called them
and seated them in two very comfortable chairs
of his own making.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the old man, as he began serving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the simple meal, “there’s been many footsteps
leadin’ up to them bogs as has never come out
o’ them. I remember once, when I was only a
young feller, how two o’ the ugliest villains I ever
see got their deserts. Ye see, these here rascals
was tryin’ to steal some pow’ful val’ble trees
here’bouts. They had it all fixed up fine how they
were goin’ to git away with ’em. Wall, they wuz
hard to work one night loadin’ the logs on a
wagon so’s they could get ’em away before
mornin’, when all a sudden they hears a voice
and, lookin’ up, sees two great big, green eyes a
glarin’ right at ’em. With a yell they runs off
through the woods as fast as their legs could
carry ’em, and never stops to look where they’s
goin’. All a sudden, the first man slips an’ falls,
ketchin’ hold o’ t’other and draggin’ him with
him. With a blood-curdlin’ cry, they found they
was bein’ pulled under. In a little while there
was nothin’ to show they’d been there, ’ceptin’
their footprints leadin’ up to the edge o’ the bog.
Me and a friend o’ mine was jest in time to see
the last o’ ’em disappear.”</p>

<p>The boys had listened in horrified silence to this
story and, as Old Sam stopped, Bob broke in
breathlessly to ask, “But where did the green
eyes come from?”</p>

<p>“Why, seems them belonged to a bobcat,” Old
Sam began, but was again interrupted, this time
by Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>“A bobcat?” he exclaimed. “I’ve heard there
are some around here, but I haven’t seen any yet.”</p>

<p>“Waal, ye will! They ain’t so pow’ful plentiful,
but once in a while ye ketch sight o’ one.
Me an’ me friend, after we seen the finish o’ the
rascals, we went back to see what mischief they’d
been up to, and then, all o’ a sudden, my friend
sez, sez he, ‘Look a-there, Sam, I reckon that’s
what skeered them durned thieves!’</p>

<p>“I looked where he wuz pintin’ an’ I see them
terr’ble glarin’ eyes. I tell ye, lads, they made
my hair jest raise itself right up on my head, an’
I hadn’t no guilty conscience, nuther! Wall,
quick as a flash my friend, he up with his
rifle an’ popped that there pesky crittur right
through the eyes!”</p>

<p>Just then a menacing rattle came from one corner
of the cabin that made the boys jump from
their seats in alarm.</p>

<p>“Don’t be skeered!” Old Sam chuckled.
“That there is one o’ my rattlers as is waitin’
fur the man to come an’ take ’em to the museem.
If ye like, I’ll show ye my c’lection.”</p>

<p>On the boys expressing an earnest desire to see
the collection, Old Sam led the way to a couple
of glass-covered boxes that stood in a corner of
the cabin. In each box were two snakes; in one
two rattlers were writhing and twisting, and in
the other two unusually large and beautifully
marked copperheads were lodged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>As the boys pressed forward eagerly to examine
them, one of the rattlesnakes coiled itself
and gave forth an ominous warning. Instinctively
the boys drew back with a shudder of repulsion.</p>

<p>“They’re awfully treacherous creatures&mdash;those
snakes!” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“Wall, yes, they be!” Old Sam drawled, “but
they has one thing to recommend ’em, anyway.
They always gives warnin’ afore they strikes, so
ye kin get out o’ the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Ben agreed, then added,
“Haven’t you ever been bitten, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he replied. “Come pretty nigh
it, sometimes, though. Many a time I’ve found
the critters hangin’ on to my boots. I had a cat
once what used to ketch a pow’ful lot o’ snakes
fur me. He could do it a durned sight better’n
I could myself!”</p>

<p>“I never knew that cats could catch snakes,”
said Bob, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Wall, that there one o’ mine could. Every
day he used to go with me when I hunted the
critters.”</p>

<p>“Tell us how he did it,” the two boys said in
the same breath, and Sam, delighted by the interest
they showed, willingly complied.</p>

<p>“Wall, it wuz this way,” he began. “Tommy&mdash;that
wuz what I called him&mdash;would hunt
around till he found a good big rattler. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
he’d creep on him on them soft paws o’ his’n,
then all a sudden, when he wuz just in front o’
him, he’d make a little noise and hold up his paw.
At the noise the snake would coil hisself up into
a ball and rattle somethin’ turr’ble. But Tommy,
he’d never stir an inch. That would make the
reptile awful mad, and he’d strike out at that
raised paw o’ Tommy’s with all the strength he
had in him. That’s just what the cat had been
countin’ on, an’ when the rattler struck, he would
jump aside quick as lightnin’. Then when the
snake would go past him, Tommy, he’d jump and
land right on the critter’s neck, just below his
head. Yes, he wuz great on ketchin’ snakes, old
Tommy wuz!”</p>

<p>“What became of the cat?” Ben asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, he lived to be sixteen years old, Tommy
did, and at the end o’ that time passed off quiet
and peaceful like. He lived a happy life and a
durn useful one, too, which is more’n you kin say
fur most cats,” he added.</p>

<p>Although the boys would gladly have stayed
longer with this old man who knew so many interesting
tales, they knew Scout-Master Durland
would be anxious about them. They urged Old
Sam to go with them back to camp and stay to
dinner, but he refused on the plea that the
“museem man” was coming to take away “them
durned reptiles,” and he had to be on hand to
receive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go with ye a little ways through the
woods, though,” he said, “and see that ye don’t
get stuck in no more bogs.”</p>

<p>So they started merrily for the camp. Old
Sam’s bacon and strange stories had had a good
effect on the two boys and they felt themselves
again.</p>

<p>The snake hunter gave all the bogs a wide
berth, and beguiled the way so pleasantly with
his interesting talk that before they knew it they
were almost on top of the camp.</p>

<p>Bob and Ben tried their best then to persuade
Old Sam to go in with them, if only for a few
minutes, but again he begged off, saying, “Ef I
once git in there, lads, I couldn’t pull myself
away, an’ then what would the poor museem man
say?”</p>

<p>The boys didn’t know and didn’t care, but as
they saw he could not be moved from his determination,
they reluctantly let him go. Before
they parted, however, the boys overwhelmed him
with thanks and gratitude.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” he said, for the second time that
day. “’Twan’t no more’n any Christian would
hev done.”</p>

<p>But although this was true to some extent, the
boys looked after his disappearing figure with no
lessening of their respect and love. With a sigh
they finally turned away and started toward camp
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>In a few minutes they found themselves surrounded
by the Scouts, who were greatly relieved
to have the two runaways with them again.</p>

<p>“Where are those raspberries, Ben, that you
were going to bring for the dumplings?” Dick
cried.</p>

<p>Then Ben told the excited boys all about this
mishap and how loyally Bob had come to his
rescue. When he spoke of the snake hunter’s
timely arrival and how he and Bob together had
pulled him out of the bog, the Scouts sent up
three cheers that set Don barking.</p>

<p>Reserving the snake hunter’s stories to tell
around the campfire that night, Ben concluded:
“I’m sorry, fellows, that I wasn’t able to get
you those raspberries! My intentions were good,
I assure you, but I was prevented by ‘circumstances
over which I had no control,’ as contracts
say.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, Ben,” said Jack,
“you look better to us than all the raspberry
dumplings going!” and that he voiced the general
feeling was shown by the boys’ hearty, “You
bet your life!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="fs60">THE BROKEN TRESTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Never had a day dawned more brightly, never
had the skies been bluer than on the morning of
a day a week or so later, to which the Scouts
had looked forward with so much pleasure; and
yet it proved to be a day of disaster.</p>

<p>The unfortunate happenings had begun with
an accident to Mr. Durland. He had stepped
carelessly upon a loose stone, and, his foot slipping,
he had been thrown from his balance, and
had rolled and slid down the steep mountain
side. He had grasped at some stout bushes and
so managed to stay his fall until help could reach
him. His Troop had all been thankful enough
when at last they had him at the top again and
had found no bones were broken, and that there
was apparently no more serious injury done than
some severe bruises.</p>

<p>Thankful as they were, the accident had affected
them all, for there was not a boy in that Adirondack
camp who did not love Mr. Durland. He had
been their Scout-Master ever since the formation
of the Thirty-ninth Troop, and in all that time
they had spent together the Scouts had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
nothing in him that the most critical would have
cared to change if he could. His never-failing
cheerfulness, his quick sympathy and full understanding
of boy nature, his hearty praise for work
well done or any act that proved the doer a
worthy Scout; the quiet reproof, when reproof
could no longer be withheld&mdash;all these traits had
endeared their Scout-Master to the members of
the Thirty-ninth.</p>

<p>So it had been with thankful hearts but subdued
spirits that they had again taken up the
trail.</p>

<p>Then venturesome Tom Binns had foolishly
wandered away, and it had taken an hour of
searching before they had located him.</p>

<p>They had gone on quietly without any other unpleasant
incident and had covered several miles of
their hike where there had come literally “lightning
out of a clear sky.”</p>

<p>One moment the sky had been of clearest blue,
the sun shining brightly. The next the air had
been filled with a lurid yellow light. It had thundered
and lightened and, by sheer good fortune,
just in the nick of time, the boys had stumbled
upon a refuge formed by three great rocks piled
one against the other. Against and between these
they managed to crowd, but it had offered only
meagre protection from the fury of the storm.
Such a storm had never been witnessed before by
any of them. It was preceded by a terrific wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
which bent the saplings to the ground, wrenched
up great trees by their roots, casting them aside
like a giant’s discarded playthings. This it had
made the boys’ hearts ache to see, for they had
come to love the trees, and regard them almost as
friends.</p>

<p>Then came the rain, in driving sheets that hid
even nearby objects. It seemed as if the very
floodgates of heaven were opened, and that it
poured in “floods that came and came again,”
until in every depression there was a small lake
and wherever the ground sloped downward small
rivers ran.</p>

<p>Not a living thing was to be seen, for every wild
creature had taken refuge from the fury of the
storm in its deepest woodland shelter and nestled
there quivering, while still the thunder rolled, the
lightning flashed and the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a peculiarly vivid flash, and
then a crash that seemed as if the heavens themselves
must be falling, and a tall oak directly
opposite the Scouts’ shelter was riven by lightning.
Straight through the center of the tree
the blue fire ran, from topmost leaf to roots, and
the giant parted and fell crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>At last, after what seemed a never-ending wait,
the deluge was over, and the Scouts came out of
their refuge, stretching their limbs, and again
took up the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>At first their progress was slow, for in every
hollow the water lay so deep that they were forced
to abandon the trail and skirt around it. In more
than one place a great tree lay across the trail
and they must either go around or push through
the fallen branches. All this took time and effort,
and the boys were tired when they reached a part
of the trail that led outside the woods, where they
found the going much easier.</p>

<p>Then they reached the river, along whose banks
the trail led to within a mile of the county town,
for to purchase some much needed stores in the
village had been the object of this hike.</p>

<p>Long before they reached the river they could
hear its rushing waters and so were prepared to
see it swollen, but the sight which now met their
eyes was beyond anything they had imagined.</p>

<p>The raging volume of water that came tearing
down the river course was more like some great,
swirling cataract than a river. They remembered
how it had looked on the day they came to camp
as, crossing on the trestle which spanned it, they
had looked down upon it from the train, and
admired its quiet beauty. Then the blue sky was
mirrored in its quiet depths, now a great mass of
whirling, muddy water, sweeping all before it.</p>

<p>Recovering a little from their amazement at the
sight of the rushing current, they went on down
the trail until the trestle came in sight. At the
first glance they stood as if turned to stone. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
several minutes the Scouts gazed into the faces of
one another, and, though no word was spoken,
whole volumes were read in eyes full of alarm and
faces which, despite the stout hearts back of them,
were blanched with fear.</p>

<p>It had needed only one glance to see it all. On
its course down the valley, the swollen river, overflowing
its banks at many places, had loosened the
earth from the roots of many trees growing along
its edge and had borne them along. Several of
these had been wedged against the foundation
supports of the trestle and on the farther side
had loosened several of them. This had caused the
frame to sag away from the track, leaving the
rails loosened and out of place for many feet at
that end of the trestle, and&mdash;appalling thought!
the afternoon express was due in little more than
an hour. Is it any wonder that the thought left
the Scouts white and speechless?</p>

<p>In order to give the alarm to the on-coming train
it would be necessary to cross the river. Ordinarily
this would be easy enough, for here the
river had neither great depth nor strong current,
but one glance now at the raging, boiling torrent
that had taken the place of the usually placid
river showed that to be dangerous, if not impossible.</p>

<p>As the Troop stood there hesitating, trying to
decide on the best thing to do, there was constantly
before each one a picture of the train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
speeding out on that broken trestle, then falling,
its cars piling up one upon the other, the shrieks
and groans of the injured&mdash;Ah, but they must
not think of these things! It would make them
unable to plan. That they must do something to
save the train went without saying. No true Scout
could stand or had ever stood by when there was
disaster to be prevented or life to be saved.</p>

<p>“Now, Scouts,” said Mr. Durland in a resolute
voice, “here is an emergency that will test all
your training. We must act quickly, or it will be
too late.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a new thought flashed into his mind
and now, looking into the earnest faces of the
Scouts, he saw the thought that was in his own
mind grow in theirs.</p>

<p>The trestle! But to run along that trestle over
the mass of seething, angry water, when the slightest
misstep meant death, to warn the on-coming
train&mdash;could he ask or expect such a heroic
deed from these Scouts, the oldest of whom was
scarcely more than a boy? He must consider.</p>

<p>The wind that had risen to a hurricane before
the storm had broken now began to rise again,
and he knew that this would increase the peril
fourfold. What was his duty to these boys?
Should he teach them at this crisis that their first
duty was to themselves, or that it was their great
privilege to risk their own lives to save others?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>

<p>His decision was made, and, raising his head,
he quickly called for a volunteer.</p>

<p>Every Scout, to the last man, stood ready!</p>

<p>Strong man as he was, Mr. Durland felt the
tears rush to his eyes, and he could not speak for
a moment for the choking in his throat. Then
he said, “Well, Scouts, I’m proud of every one
of you, but you see you cannot <em>all</em> go.” Then
glancing keenly about, he continued: “I will let
you choose your own man. Whom do you think
best fitted, not by courage, for you are <em>all</em> that,
but by physical strength and steadiness of head
to undertake this task?”</p>

<p>And there was but one word spoken, as with
but one voice, “Jack!”</p>

<span class="fs60">THE SAVING OF THE TRAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Without a word Jack threw off his Scout’s pack
and prepared for his task, but turned to ask what
he should do for something with which to flag
the train. Harry French whipped out a large
red silk handkerchief and quickly passed it over.
Without a moment’s delay Jack swung off, with
Mr. Durland’s “Take care of yourself, Jack,” and
the good-bye shouts of his fellow Scouts ringing
in his ears.</p>

<p>His companions held their breath as he swung
out over the rushing water. Until now they had
failed to notice in the excitement that the sky
had again darkened and that there was every
sign of another downpour. The darkness increased,
and again came that terrible rain in such
sheets that, strain their eyes as they would, they
could not see a trace of Jack.</p>

<p>And now Jack, brave Jack, was all alone in his
struggle. Blinded by the wind and the pouring
rain, he could scarcely see one iron girder of
the trestle. Standing with difficulty and swaying
dizzily, he waited until a flash of lightning showed
the way before him for one blinding second. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that second he calculated the distance between the
girders and now crept on from girder to girder
over those hungry waters that seemed to leap at
him in an attempt to drag him down into their
raging depths.</p>

<p>Once he slipped and fell between the girders
and for an instant thought that he was lost, but
with cat-like agility he caught at a projecting
beam, and, though the angry waters dashed over
him and sought to break his hold, they could not,
and he pulled himself slowly back to the trestle.</p>

<p>No standing up now! He had learned the
danger of that. On hands and knees, drenched
by rain and river, buffeted by the terrible wind
that tore at him like some living enemy determined
on his destruction, he crawled painfully
along inch by inch and foot by foot.</p>

<p>His hands, torn and bleeding from his desperate
attempts to hold onto the rough iron, almost refused
to obey his will. The cold wind and rain
chilled him to the marrow and it was only his
strong, determined will and dauntless heart that
held him to his task.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he was going so slowly,
so terribly slowly, when there was such need of
haste. He must hurry! He told himself that the
short hour before the train was due must already
be gone.</p>

<p>At any moment now he might hear that dreaded
whistle and see the monster train bearing down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
upon him. What if it should come while he was
still on the trestle?</p>

<p>For a moment he stopped overwhelmed, controlled
only by that physical fear of death that
is common to us all. The thought of going down
into that swirling flood and yielding his young
life to those merciless waves was more than he
could bear. Only for a moment did this thought
sway him. Almost instantly the realization that
upon him depended other lives, and that he must
hurry if he would hope to save them restored
his courage and banished every thought of self.
Again he crept on, trying to hurry and constantly
beaten and held back by wind and rain.</p>

<p>On, on, he crept, with bleeding fingers, toward
the end of the trestle. Would he never reach it?
The downpour of rain lessened, and it grew
lighter. He strained his eyes, and, yes! there
before him, only a few yards distant now, was
the end of the bridge and beyond it, wet rails
glistening, the track stretched away.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, Jack looked eagerly, searchingly
along that track. Nothing in sight, he told
himself exultingly. He was going to be in time!</p>

<p>The storm was over now, and in the clearer
light he hurried along, his bleeding hands and
bruised knees forgotten in the joyful thought that
he was going to succeed&mdash;but at this moment
there was a terrible crash and noise of breaking
and splintering wood, and he stood transfixed at
the sight before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>The end of the trestle the entire width across
had given way and fallen with a crash and now
lay, a broken mass of wreckage, half on land and
half in water. An open space about six feet
wide yawned between Jack and the bank.</p>

<p>Not very much space, you think, for an agile
Boy Scout trained in all sorts of athletics to
cover; and, ordinarily, that would have been so.
But now the ground under and beside the tracks
was soft and yielding from the rain and, to make
the task of jumping still more difficult, the mass
of wreckage served as a dam and the water flowed
out over the roadbed, making it impossible to
calculate the leap.</p>

<p>Our Scout stood there for a long minute trying
to decide what to do. If it had been only his
own life that he had to consider, he would not
have hesitated a second, but he had to reflect
that if lost there would be no one to warn the
express, which must now be very close at hand.</p>

<p>Whatever he did he must do quickly. He glanced
around keenly, but could see nothing to aid him.
Desperate, he looked again. Ah, yes! There,
a foot or so beneath where he was standing, he
saw a beam of wood projecting from the water.
Jack could only see a few feet of it, for the rest
of it was under water, but it was his only chance
and he took it unhesitatingly. Drawing off his
shoes that his feet might get a better grip, he
stepped down upon it and felt his way cautiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
along until he came to the broken end of the beam.
Knowing that he had gained several feet, he now
leaped out over the flood. As he jumped, he
leaned far forward, and it was well he did, for
as his feet touched the soft earth, it slid from
under them and it was only by grasping at the
rails that he kept himself from slipping backward
into the water.</p>

<p>Hurrah! he was on firm ground at last, and
all else was forgotten in the triumph.</p>

<p>Toot! Toot! T-o-o-t! It was the whistle of
the express. He was just in time. He dashed
up the track toward the on-coming train with
the speed of an arrow. He had sore need now
of all his athletic training and ran as he had
never run before. There around the bend, about
a fourth of a mile away, appeared the express,
ten minutes behindhand, and in consequence putting
on extra speed.</p>

<p>Jack planted himself firmly in the middle of
the track and waved the red danger signal to
and fro, his heart singing with joy. He expected
to see the express slow down, but to his amazement
it did nothing of the kind. They did not
seem to see him!</p>

<p>What should he do? The train, with the broken
trestle ahead of it, must not be allowed to take
that awful plunge. He must stop it!</p>

<p>He waved the red flag more frantically than
before, but still the train, unheeding, came on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Two minutes more and it would be upon him.
Now came the supreme test of his Scout training.
Would he fail?</p>

<p>Lightning quick he thought and decided.
Springing from the track, he caught up a rock,
and, as the train came abreast of him, hurled it
through the window of the cab. Then, well nigh
exhausted as he was, he ran along by the side
of the track.</p>

<p>As the train sped by him he heard startled
exclamations and shouted oaths mingled with the
sound of the breaking glass. He caught a glimpse
of the engineer face thrust from the cab window,
and once more he frantically waved the red flag.</p>

<p>At last, at last, he heard the grinding and
whistling of the air-brakes as the express began
to slow down. So great had been its speed that
its momentum carried it on even when all steam
had been shut off and the air-brakes applied.</p>

<p>The engineer and fireman, now fully aware of
some terrible danger, feared the train could not
be stopped in time. With bated breath they
waited, while nearer and nearer crept that awful
gap. On, on, went the great locomotive until
within two scant feet of the broken trestle when,
with whistling brakes and grinding wheels, it
came to a full stop.</p>

<p>From cab and car people poured, gathering
around Jack, whose white face, bleeding hands
and clothing torn almost in shreds told their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
story of the terrible ordeal through which he had
just passed.</p>

<p>As it happened, there were several wealthy
mine owners on the train going up into the
Adirondacks to verify a report of a rich vein
in that locality. With them was the superintendent
of the road, likewise interested in the
mining project. His family, consisting of his
wife, his married daughter and her husband and
their two young children, were also of the party.
It was for their accommodation that a most
luxuriously furnished private car had been added
to the regular train, and very soon Jack, quite
restored, found himself sitting in a wonderfully
comfortable chair, and the center of attraction.</p>

<p>With keenest interest all listened to his account
of the storm in the mountains and as, in answer
to their many questions, they drew from him
the story of the crossing of the trestle, their
hearts glowed with gratitude to the brave Boy
Scout who had done so much for them. They
quickly made up a purse, and the superintendent
of the road presented it to Jack, saying, “This
is from the passengers, for they recognize the
great debt you have placed upon them, and I can
say for the road itself that it will be quick to
recognize in a substantial way the service you
have rendered it.”</p>

<p>Jack drew back, and firmly refused to accept
the reward, first of all because he did not wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
it, and second because it is against Scout rules
to accept a reward for any such service. When
the passengers saw how determined he was in
the matter, their admiration knew no bounds, and
if Jack had not been as strong minded as we
know him to be, it is to be feared that he would
have grown conceited.</p>

<p>The superintendent soon gave orders to the
engineer to make best speed in backing the train
to the county town, only a mile or two away,
and there Jack alighted, and after a short wait
was joined by the rest of the Troop, who had
gained the town by means of a bridge which had
withstood the storm some miles down the river.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="fs60">A STRANGE DUEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Lounging in all sorts of careless attitudes
around the campfire that evening, the boys were
playing with Don. That exuberant animal was
an unfailing source of delight. No matter how
much he had tramped through the day, he was
always ready for a frolic with the boys. All of
them were fond of him and since he had led the
Scouts to the cave and saved the lives of Jack
and Tom just when the situation seemed most
desperate, he had become the idol of the camp.
He was constantly learning new tricks and perfecting
those he had. Now he rolled over and
over, turned somersaults, stood on his hind legs
and marched as a soldier, stretched himself out
and played dead and went through all his extensive
stock of tricks. Nor did he do it as a
matter of obedience to the shout of a command,
but took as much delight in it as did the boys
themselves. It was easily seen that he thought
himself as important as any Scout in camp and
there were times, it must be said, when the boys
agreed with him.</p>

<p>Now as he barked joyfully and leaped and ran
from one to another, Ben remarked, “Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
there’s no use talking, there’s something wrong
with a man who doesn’t love a good dog!”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” said Tom, who, since Don
had saved his life, had redoubled his affection
for the dog. “They’re the finest animals in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack, while Don squatted on his
haunches and looked in his eyes adoringly,
“they’re the most faithful and affectionate beasts
on earth. They’ll never go back on you, no matter
what happens. You’re just the same to them
whether you have a dollar or a million; whether
you’re a helpless outcast or the President of the
United States. There aren’t many human friends
that will stick by you everywhere in foul weather
as well as fair weather, but a dog always will.
He will trot along with you; he’ll fight for you;
he’ll forgive all your impatience and ill-treatment,
and he wouldn’t hesitate a moment to give
up his life to save yours. They’re noble fellows,
sure enough, aren’t they, old dog?” as he fondled
the shaggy head caressingly.</p>

<p>“And they’re so intelligent,” said Pete.
“They’ll follow a trail anywhere. You may try
to cover up your tracks by all sorts of tricks,
by walking backward in your footsteps, by running
along fences or jumping from rock to rock,
but although you may confuse them, they’ll stick
to it until soon or late they pick up the trail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
again. The only way to fool them utterly is to
take to the water and wade through it, but even
then you have got to head for land sooner or
later and the chances are they’ll get you. You
know how hard it used to be in the old slave-holding
days for a runaway to escape. I’ve heard
that in some of the places of Europe&mdash;Belgium
I think&mdash;trained dogs are a regular part of the
police force and a most important part too, if
you believe all that is told about them.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick Crawford, who, after discharging
some of the routine duties of the camp,
had joined the group, “I know of a famous case
that shows both those qualities of the dog, his
affection and his intelligence. It all happened
four hundred years ago and yet it is so interesting
and remarkable that the story has lived all
this time.”</p>

<p>The boys clamored to hear it and Dick went on:</p>

<p>“There was a young man in Paris, we’ll call
him Aubrey for short, of good birth and breeding
and moving in the gay world of fashion. He
had a large circle of friends and owned a magnificent
greyhound. It was a splendid brute, whom
people turned about to watch as he followed his
master through the streets.</p>

<p>“One day there was a great tournament in
Paris, a very gay and splendid occasion, and his
friends were surprised to see that Aubrey wasn’t
there. They thought this was strange because he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
had counted very much on this coming event and
had shown the greatest interest in it. Still they
thought that something had detained him, but
when on the second and third days he was also
absent, they began to be worried about him.</p>

<p>“On the fourth morning a great friend of
Aubrey, whom we’ll call De Narsac, heard a
scratching at his door. He arose and found there
his friend’s greyhound. The poor brute was
wounded and had evidently been without food
for days, so that his ribs almost showed through
his flesh. De Narsac gave him food that he ate
as famished. The appearance of the dog in such
a condition deepened his suspicions that harm
had come to his friend. The dog kept running
about the apartment, whining and looking at him
imploringly and plainly asking him to follow.
Convinced now that something was wrong, he
hastily dressed and followed him through the
streets of Paris. The dog led him without a
moment’s hesitation several miles out into the
country through a forest that had a bad reputation
as a resort for thieves and outlaws. Coming
to some freshly disturbed earth under a great
oak tree, he fell upon it and began scratching
and whining pitifully. De Narsac and some
friends he had brought with him began to dig
and soon uncovered the murdered body of Aubrey.</p>

<p>“On their return to the city, they met a group
of young men on one of the main streets. As soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
as the dog caught sight of one of them he growled
furiously, crouching and then leaped at the man’s
throat. The courtier, whom we’ll call Macaire,
beat off the dog with the help of his friends, but
the greyhound made unavailing efforts to renew
the attack.</p>

<p>“The sudden fury of the dog aroused suspicion
and a little quiet investigation showed that sometime
before there had been a bitter quarrel between
Aubrey and Macaire.</p>

<p>“The matter came to the ears of the King,
who determined to sift the matter to the bottom.
He gave a great function in the royal palace and
so managed that Macaire with a dozen other
courtiers stood in a group at the right hand of
the throne. By previous arrangement, De Narsac
entered, accompanied by the greyhound, who, the
instant his eye caught sight of Macaire, made
a tremendous bound and bore him to the floor.
It seemed to the King and all present that Providence
had pointed out Aubrey’s murderer.
Macaire denied it violently but, in accordance
with the ideas of the time, it was arranged that
the matter should be left to the judgment of
heaven. In other words, the dog and the man
were to fight a duel. It was supposed that eternal
justice and wisdom would select the winner. If
the dog won, the murderer of Aubrey stood revealed.
If, on the other hand, Macaire came out
victor, he was to be adjudged innocent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>“A duel between a man and a dog!” exclaimed
Ben who, with the other boys, had listened
breathlessly to Dick’s story. “That doesn’t seem
fair. How could they fix it so that each would
have an even show?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, “perhaps it wouldn’t be
possible to make a thing of that kind exactly fair
and even between a man and a dog, but they
figured it out and made it as fair as they could.
The man was armed with a heavy club and the
dog had to rely upon his teeth and claws. A
barrel was provided for him, in which he could
take refuge when too hard pressed and get ready
to renew the attack.</p>

<p>“The affair came off before a tremendous
crowd. All the leading people of Paris and the
court were present. The instant the dog was
brought in he tugged at the leash and being
freed, leaped at his enemy. Macaire fought with
the fury of despair; but the consciousness of
guilt unnerved him and most of his blows beat
the air. The dog returned again and again to
the attack and, finally, leaping through Macaire’s
guard, caught him by the throat and threw him
to the ground. He shrieked for help and confessed
his guilt. Justice was keen and quick in
those days, and that very night Macaire was led
out to execution. The dog had avenged his
master.”</p>

<p>The Scouts drew a long breath as Dick finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
his exciting story and Pete ejaculated, “Well,
that certainly was some dog!”</p>

<p>“They thought so at the time,” said Dick,
“and put up a monument to him that can be seen
even now.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, turning to Don, “you’re
not so big and strong as that great greyhound, old
fellow, but I bet you know as much, and no matter
what happened to any of us, you would stand by
us to the very end. Wouldn’t you, Don?” and
Don, looking eloquently into his master’s eyes,
wig-wagged, “Yes!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="fs60">TOO LATE!</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The morning of the last day of the month
dawned bright and clear.</p>

<p>The day before, Harry, as he had promised
Crawford he would do, had come over to the
Boy Scout camp and had a long talk with Mr.
Durland. Flannigan had not come back from his
prospecting trip nor had they heard from him
in any way. The only conjecture was that he
had been delayed longer than he had expected,
but had probably planned his return so as to
stop at the junction point to receive the express
package that always arrived for him on the last
day of the month in order to meet the payroll,
and from there would drive over to the logging
camp.</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary that somebody
should reach there before the arrival of the train
in order to give him ample warning, and let him
make his arrangements accordingly. Jack was
selected as best fitted for that important duty
and immediately after breakfast he started off
for the Junction.</p>

<p>He gave himself plenty of time. It would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
do to take any risk when theft was in the air and
when possibly a life also depended upon his getting
there before the train. The distance from
the Boy Scout camp to the Junction was about
five miles as the crow flies. If he had been able
to go by the road, he could easily have made it
in a little over an hour. The path, however, lay
chiefly through the woods and there were brooks
to be crossed and occasional hills to be climbed
and for all this Jack had to make allowances.
Thanks to the efforts of the Boy Scout Pathfinders,
the district had been thoroughly surveyed
and rough paths indicated, and as Jack himself
had been in the thick of this exploring, he had a
perfectly clear idea of the shortest and easiest
way to get there.</p>

<p>The train was due at the Junction at ten thirty-five.
Usually it was behind time. It ran on a
little spur jutting off from the main road. It
was a single narrow-gauge track, with only one
train each way every day. It carried both freight
and passengers and stopped, as its patrons sometimes
grumbled, at “every dog kennel” on the
way. The chances were that it would be late,
but then again on this one occasion it might happen
to be on time and Jack could take no risks.
He figured that, with all the roughness of the
road, he could make the distance easily in two
hours. He gave himself an extra hour and a
half, however, to allow for any possible hindrance
and left camp at about seven o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>It was a splendid morning. A slight haze tempered
the heat of the sun and made walking a
delight. As Jack swung into his stride, the charm
of the morning took possession of him. The full
tide of youth and strength ran through his brain.
The balsam of the woods filled his nostrils. The
woods were full of life. Birds sang in the trees
overhead. He caught glimpses of chipmunks and
squirrels gliding through the bushes and occasionally
crossing the path. It was good to be
alive, and it seemed scarcely possible that on
such a day robbers and murderers were abroad
and the possibility of a crime near at hand.</p>

<p>As this last thought came to him his step
quickened. He didn’t anticipate any danger in
his mission, and yet his blood was stirred by
the possibilities that lurked in the day’s work. He
had no idea that he himself would be concerned
in it or come face to face with the robbers.</p>

<p>What he had to do after all was perfectly simple.
He only had to warn Flannigan and he knew
enough of that individual to have perfect confidence
in him. He was sure that the big, burly
Irishman could easily hold his own if it came
to a tussle. But there would be no tussle. He
was sure of that. All the foreman had to do
was to take no chances in going by the main road,
but to take a less traveled path, rough, to be sure,
but over which a horse could be driven, and thus
reach the camp. It was a much longer road, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in this case at least the old proverb was true
that “the longest way around is the shortest way
home.”</p>

<p>He had no doubt that Flannigan would be at
the station. No matter how important his business
might have been, he would never let pay-day
go by without turning up in camp. That was the
one unwritten law of the logging camps that was
like the laws of the Medes and the Persians and
could not be broken. The rough characters that
Flannigan had to deal with in their hard-worked
and narrow lives looked forward all through the
month to that one day of the pay envelope. To
be sure, the money didn’t last long when they
got it. A big spree in the county town usually
followed and, after a day or two of gambling
and drunkenness, the men stumbled back to the
camp and began to work for another month, and
dream of the next pay-day. They were quick
tempered at the best, would listen to no argument
or explanation and only the sight of the money
would appease them. If Flannigan did not turn
up at the camp that day, there would be a riot,
and nobody knew this better than Flannigan himself.
Therefore he was sure to be on hand.</p>

<p>While Jack was thus pressing steadily forward,
two men lay in a clump of bushes alongside the
road about half way between the Junction and
the logging camp. They had chosen another place
than that on which they had first determined.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
They felt a vague uneasiness regarding the Boy
Scouts. While the sudden appearance of Don
had given rise to some misgivings, they had not
been sure that they had been overheard. They
had missed Dick on his trip to the logging camp
to give warning and though after that day they
had kept a sharp lookout, they had seen no proof
of any communication from the Boy Scouts to
the lumber camp. As a matter of fact, on the
strict injunction of Mr. Durland, the Scouts had
kept carefully away from that section since that
day. Still on the mere chance they had thought
to “make assurance doubly sure,” and had
picked upon a new location where, squatting in
the bushes, they waited the coming of Flannigan.</p>

<p>The intervening days spent in wandering about
the woods and brooding over their plot had not
improved their appearance. They were unshaven
and unkempt, and their clothes hung on them in
tatters. But if their appearance was bad, their
tempers were still worse. Their rankling bitterness
and hatred of all society had turned them
into wild beasts.</p>

<p>“Curse him!” growled Red, as O’Brien was
called, “we’ll settle his hash this time!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Lavine. “By gar, I get even
with zat man to-day if I swing for it!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be pretty keerful,” said Red.
“He’s a moighty handy man with his fists, begorra!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<p>“His feests I fear not,” replied Lavine.
“What are his feests against zis knife?” and he
ran his hand significantly across the razor edge
on an evil-looking hunting knife. “Do you zink
he weel hev a pistol?”</p>

<p>“No fear uv that,” said Red. “He’s too cock-sure
of himself.”</p>

<p>Just at the turning of the road they had felled
a tree and with true woodmen’s skill had arranged
it so that some of the heavier branches
lay across the road. They thought that Flannigan,
on reaching the obstruction, would be forced
to get down from the wagon in order to remove
it and clear a path. While he was bending over,
they planned to spring upon him from behind
with their clubs. Taken by surprise, they figured
that he would be helpless in their hands. The
knives they held as a last resort. Their thought
of vengeance went no further than to give the
prostrate man a terrible beating and perhaps
maim him for life. It would be safer than actually
murdering him and the pursuit was likely
to be less keen than if they had killed their man.
Yet their knives were there and in a pinch neither
one would have flinched from using them should
it come to that.</p>

<p>“He’ll soon be here now,” said Red, looking
at the sun.</p>

<p>Lavine responded with a growl and an oath,
and the two outlaws drew their belts tighter and
waited for the coming of their prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile Jack had caught sight of the
Junction from the brow of the last hill. His
watch told him that he had an hour and a half
to spare and he knew that he could easily make
the distance in fifteen minutes, leaving plenty of
time. He stepped out briskly and came to the
edge of a little brook. It was only about a foot
deep and there were stepping-stones leading
from one bank to the other. As he neared the
farther bank, a round stone slipped from under
him and he plunged forward, striking his head
against a tree stump on the edge of the brook.
The world swam around him and then his senses
left him.</p>

<p>How long he lay there he never knew. When
he opened his eyes he looked around bewildered.
His legs were wet to the waist where he had lain
in the brook. He carried his hand to his forehead
that ached horribly and when he withdrew
it, found it covered with blood. Where was he?
What had happened?</p>

<p>As he staggered to his feet the thought of his
mission came to him. How late was it? He
looked at the sun. It seemed much higher in
the heavens. Could it be possible that he was
too late for the train? He glanced at his watch.
It was no longer going. The force with which
he had fallen had stopped it and the hands marked
nine thirteen. He remembered that a few minutes
before his fall it had been nine eight. How long
had he lain there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly a thrill ran through his veins. Over
the hill came the shrill whistle of a locomotive.
It must be the train that Flannigan was to meet.
There wasn’t any other that morning. Could
he possibly be in time? He knew that it would
take him at least fifteen minutes, doing his best,
to get there. The train would get to the station
in less than five,&mdash;might be there now. Even
yet, he told himself, he might be in time! Perhaps
there would be a car to be shifted on a
siding. Even after the train had gone, Flannigan
might stop for a chat and gossip with the station
agent. There might be some delay in signing
for the express package. A dozen things might
happen to help him. At least he might get near
enough to wave his arms and attract attention.</p>

<p>While these thoughts rushed through his mind,
now clearing from the effects of the fall, he had
struggled to his feet and started dizzily on his
way. At first he staggered, but with every step
he felt himself getting stronger. Only a little
part of the remaining distance was up a slight
ascent but after that it would be easy sailing. All
the way from that to the station would be down
hill.</p>

<p>A groan passed from his lips as he reached
the brow of the hill, half a mile from the Junction.
The train had reached the station, let off
a single passenger and, grunting and groaning,
was just pulling out. Alongside the platform was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
a buckboard drawn by an old white horse. Holding
the reins was a thick-set, sturdy figure, whom
he recognized as Flannigan. Jack shouted but
they could not hear him at that distance. He
blew his Scout’s whistle but still there was no
sign. He ran on, waving his hands wildly. Their
backs were to him and no one saw him. A solitary
passenger stepped into the buckboard, Flannigan
gathered up the reins, the old white horse started
off and disappeared around a turn of the road
just as Jack rushed up to the station.</p>

<p>He was too late!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="fs60">JACK’S RUN FOR LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Too late! The horrible truth flashed across
him as he flung himself on the platform, unable
to speak and almost unable to breathe. He had
failed! He had been entrusted with that mission
and he had failed. A life, perhaps two lives now,
could have been saved by a word from him and
he had failed! The picture of the men jogging
quietly along the road on that beautiful morning
without a thought or dream of danger, going to
a certain robbery and perhaps to death came
before him. He put his hands over his eyes and
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>What would Mr. Durland say? What would
the Scouts say? Above all, what would his own
conscience say to the last day of his life? He
had never yet fallen short in any important mission
and now on this day of all days he had come
miserably short, and he felt that he could never
forgive himself as long as he lived.</p>

<p>How bitterly he blamed his carelessness in
crossing the brook! Of course it was an accident,
and after it had happened he had done his best
to remedy it. But why had the accident happened?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Why had he not been more careful? Why
had he trusted that treacherous stone in crossing
the brook? His heart swelled up in bitter self-reproach.
But what was the use of that now?
That wouldn’t save a life. He was too late!</p>

<p>But <em>was</em> he too late? The thought came to
him like an electric shock and roused him from
his despair. How did he know but what he might
yet save them? While there was life, there was
hope. Was he, Jack Danby, to lie there like a
coward and give up supinely while lives hung
in the balance? No, a thousand times no! He
sprang to his feet, pushed through the door and
rushed into the little office.</p>

<p>The station agent, a long, lanky native of the
woods, was sitting with his back to him, looking
over the orders left him by the conductor. His
back was to Jack, but at his tumultuous entrance
he sprang to his feet in alarm. Jack’s appearance
was not prepossessing. His forehead was
still covered with clotted blood, his hat was gone,
his eyes were blazing. Less than that might have
startled the agent, used to the slow and quiet
ways of that isolated spot. For one brief moment
he thought of a hold-up. In a moment he had
slammed the cash drawer shut and reached for
a pistol that lay on his desk. A second glance,
however, showed him that it was no robbery he
had to fear.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” gasped Jack, “can I get a horse
around here anywhere?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Why, no, son,” replied the agent. “There
isn’t anything less than a mile from here and
that old plug ain’t no good. He’s too lazy even
to switch the flies off him. What do you want
him for?”</p>

<p>In quick, broken sentences Jack told him the
danger. The station agent became grave and
frightened. “And Mr. Scott is with him too,”
he said. “That was him as got off the train
and drove off with Flannigan. He has come up
to look over affairs at the logging camp. He
ain’t very husky, and I don’t know what would
happen to him if it came to a scrap. Flannigan’s
all right, but ’tain’t at all likely he can beat off
two men if they take him by surprise. There
ain’t no telegraph station down here and there
ain’t no telephone, either, in these woods. What
on earth are we going to do?”</p>

<p>Jack thought quickly. His brain never worked
more swiftly than when in the midst of danger.
There was nothing to hope for from the station
agent. He put his head in his hands and tried
to think.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered.</p>

<p>The road was hilly and roundabout, the horse
was old and staid and would probably go along
just at a jog trot. He had noticed that they had
driven away slowly. Mr. Scott would have a
lot to talk about on matters connected with the
camp, and they would be so engrossed in talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
that the old horse could jog along at his own
gait. Could he not intercept them?</p>

<p>A great deal of work had been done near the
station by the young pathfinders. Among other
things, they had made a rough survey of a proposed
path that, starting near the Junction, had
led almost in a straight line to a point five miles
distant, where it struck the road along which
Flannigan was driving. At intervals of half a
mile they had set up stakes with fluttering cloths
tied to them, to mark the most easily traveled
path between the two points. He happened to
know that the work had been done well. He himself
had led the squad that planted the stakes
and remembered clearly the general directions.
If he could only run across country and get to
the main road, he might beat Flannigan to it despite
the heavy handicap. In all the games of
hares and hounds he had been easily the central
figure. When with the hares he had rarely been
captured; when with the hounds he had always
brought a hare back captive. Now was the time
to show his speed. If he could do this much in
games merely, what ought he to do when lives
were at stake?</p>

<p>An instant later the astonished station agent
saw Jack bolt out of the station, running like
a frightened rabbit. The ground flew away under
him; the wind sang in his ears; his heart was
beating like a trip hammer. Lives hung on his
speed that day, and he would win or die trying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>The terrific pace at which he started soon began
to tell and now that he was fairly on his way, he
had time to think. He was going the pace that
kills, and he realized that he must husband his
speed. There was no use throwing the game away
at the very start. At the rate he was now going,
he would be blown before he had made a mile,
and five good miles lay before him. So while
his instinct pushed him on at top speed, his judgment
began to get the upper hand. He must hold
himself in, he must watch the path, he must save
his strength. He fell into a swift lope that carried
him over the ground with great rapidity, but
still left him strength in reserve. He must keep
that reserve until the last minute.</p>

<p>One pole marking a half mile flew by, then two,
three, four. Two miles already covered! Only
three yet to go. His legs began to tire, but his
wind was good. Another pole and still another.
Three miles now! He began to pant. His chest
was straining, his breath was labored. He knew
that he had reached the end of his first spurt, but
he also knew that this was only temporary.</p>

<p>Another half mile and he had gotten his second
wind. Now he felt as though he could run all
day. He threw off his coat, his kit, his hatchet.
Everything that could possibly hinder him he
shed as he went along. He wasn’t going to carry
an extra ounce. Another pole went by. He dashed
through a brook and dipped his head under for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
a moment; then, refreshed and dripping, he ran
on. Oh, if he were only in time!</p>

<p>His clean life and strong vitality were helping
him. If he had spent his strength in excesses,
he would have been absolutely helpless in this
great emergency, but young, untainted life surged
in him. He called on all his resources and they
responded.</p>

<p>Four miles now! Another pole and only a half
mile more! The main road was in sight. On and
on he flew. Now he was within a few rods. He
caught a glimpse of a white horse, with Mr. Scott
holding the reins and Flannigan getting down to
remove the branches of a tree that blocked the
path. The next instant he dashed into the road
just in time to see Red O’Brien fling himself upon
Flannigan who was bending over the tree, while
Jacques Lavine with uplifted cudgel rushed
toward Mr. Scott.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="fs60">BALKED OF THEIR PREY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Though taken by surprise, Flannigan was a
man of ready resource and tremendous strength.
His life had been spent among the rough men
of the woods, where muscle and courage were
constantly called into play. Again and again he
had come to hand grips with some of the wild
characters of the district and he had always come
out with flying colors. He had a reputation
throughout the North Woods as a rough-and-tumble
fighter. His heart was as stout as his
arms, as many a lumberjack filled with drink and
ferocity had found to his cost.</p>

<p>At this supreme moment his long experience
stood him in good stead. The warning shout of
Mr. Scott, as the robbers rushed forth from the
thicket, told him of instant danger, and he turned
so swiftly that Red, instead of leaping upon his
back, as he had intended, met him face to face.
Before he could swing his cudgel, the hairy arms
of Flannigan closed around him.</p>

<p>Back and forth the giants struggled, their eyes
glaring, each trying to get at the other’s throat.
Sheer strength and courage must decide that
battle. They surged back and forth, their muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
stretched to the utmost. At first the result hung
in the balance. Neither gained a decided advantage.
All their passions were unleashed. Red
fought for his liberty and Flannigan for his life.
Neither one thought of giving in. Neither intended
to give any quarter. They were more like
wild beasts than men.</p>

<p>As Lavine lifted his cudgel to strike Mr. Scott,
the latter dropped the reins and, snatching the
whip from the socket, swung the heavy butt on
the robber’s shoulder. With a savage curse
Lavine dropped his cudgel, and at that instant
Jack hurled himself upon him and bore him to
the ground.</p>

<p>They rolled over and over like a pair of wild-cats.
Lavine was the stronger, but Jack the
quicker. The ruffian tried to get his great, gnarled
hands on Jack’s throat, but his agile adversary
eluded his attempt at a strangle hold. With
muttered oaths Lavine tried again and again, but
suddenly finding this unavailing, his hand went
down to his belt and Jack knew he was feeling
for his knife. Now indeed it was a fight for life.
If the maddened wretch could get that knife out
of its sheath, all would be over. Jack redoubled
his efforts, but the tremendous strain was beginning
to tell. Had he been fresh, he might have
had an even chance and his agility might have
proved a match for the Frenchman’s strength.
Slowly but surely he felt the knife being drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
up inch by inch. He grasped the knife hand and
twisted it with all his might. Into that twist he
put all the power of his young and well trained
strength. With a howl of pain and rage, Lavine
shifted his knife to his other hand. Jack felt
the wrist he was twisting snap, then the knife
in the other hand gleamed before his eyes and
the knife fell once, twice. Jack felt a keen pain
like a red-hot iron flash through his shoulder.
He heard the yell of the Scouts as Dick and Tom
rushed through the bushes and flung themselves
upon Lavine. His grasp relaxed, his head was
strangely light, the trees danced around him, he
felt that he was sinking, sinking ten thousand
fathoms deep, and then for the second time that
day he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, he was lying on a
litter that the Scouts had hastily constructed.
His shoulder had been deftly bandaged and, as
he opened his eyes, they fell upon Mr. Durland,
Mr. Scott, Dick and the other Scouts crowding
around him. At a little distance were the two
robbers waiting for the wagon that Flannigan
had sent for to the camp to carry them to the
county jail. All the fight had gone out of them.
Dick and Tom, together with Mr. Scott, had disarmed
and overpowered Lavine, and he now sat
nursing his wounded wrist and cursing horribly.
Red was lying on the ground, bruised and dazed,
where Flannigan with one mighty twist had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
thrown him and, falling upon him, choked him
until he begged for mercy.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said Mr. Durland, his voice
broken with emotion. “He’s coming around all
right!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Jack, smiling faintly, “I
guess I’m worth a dozen dead men yet.”</p>

<p>“Sure yez are,” said Flannigan, his massive
frame yet panting with his exertions. “It’s a
broth of a b’y yez are, and ’tis glad and proud
I’d be if I had a son like yez! Sure, ’tis a fighter
yez are, by the powers! It takes no baby to tackle
Jacques Lavine. And don’t yez be worrying about
that knife play,” he said, turning to the group.
“There’s nothing bad’ll come of that. ’Twill
keep him in bed a day or two perhaps, but nothing
worse than that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scott came forward and put his hand on
Jack’s forehead. “My boy,” he said, “I don’t
know how to thank you. You saved my money
to-day but that was a little thing. You saved
my life as well, and I shall never forget it. If
ever you need a friend or help of any kind, call
on me! You’ve put me in your debt for life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was nothing,” said Jack, “I only
did my duty. It was only a little thing after all.
Anybody else would have done as much.”</p>

<p>He tried to lift himself as he spoke, but Mr.
Durland stopped him instantly.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” he said, with a smile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
“You’re not going to stand on your feet to-day
or for several days. You’re going right over
to the camp. Mr. Scott has sent to the county
town for a doctor and he will be there before evening.
You’re going to ride in state to-day, Jack,
as befits a hero. Who’ll volunteer,” he said,
turning to the Scouts, “to carry this litter?”</p>

<p>Who would volunteer? The boys almost fought
for the honor. They crowded around him in wild
excitement. They had always admired him, but
to-day they fairly idolized him. Mr. Durland had
to settle the matter by arranging for relays, so
that all might have a chance to carry him, and
the boys picked out for the first relay were the
object of envy to the other fellows.</p>

<p>It was a joyful, if rather subdued, party that
carried Jack back to the camp that day. They
took the utmost care to avoid the rough places,
so that there might be no shock to the wounded
shoulder. When they got him there, the first
bandages were removed, the wound was carefully
washed and dressed and Jack was put to bed.
Toward evening the doctor arrived and his examination
confirmed the opinion of Flannigan.
The knife had missed any vital spot, had touched
no arteries and, with the good care and nursing
that Jack was sure to get, he would be all right
again in two or three days.</p>

<p>“You see, old boy,” said Dick Crawford as
he sat by Jack’s bedside the following day, “it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
was like this. We knew the place that those
fellows had fixed on to waylay Flannigan, from
what we overheard in the woods. Although we
felt sure that you would get to the train in time,
we thought it better to take no chances and made
up our minds to be on hand. We could not go
too close for fear of being seen, and so we lay
behind some bushes a little way off. Of course
we didn’t know that they had changed their plans,
so when the real rumpus came, we were farther
off than we expected to be. We ran&mdash;how we
ran! I never made such time in my life before.
If we had only got there a minute sooner, you
wouldn’t be lying on your bed to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, old fellow,” said Jack. “I
know how gladly any one of you fellows would
have risked your lives to save mine. But all’s
well that ends well, and I’m mighty glad I’m
alive.”</p>

<p>“And so are we!” came with a shout from
outside the tent where the boys were gathered,
fearing to disobey the doctor’s orders to keep
Jack quiet, if they had crowded in as they had
wanted to. “Three cheers for Jack!” and they
gave them with a will.</p>

<p>The next few days came and went quickly. The
time had come for breaking camp and most of
the boys had been compelled reluctantly to go
back to town. The life-giving air of the woods,
combined with the careful nursing of Dick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Tom, who had remained behind to take care of
him, had worked wonders for Jack. His splendid
vitality and will power had assisted nature, and
the morning came when, strong and well, he too
bade farewell to the Adirondack camp.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, fellows,” he said, as they
stood upon the station waiting for their train,
“I never had such a delightful as well as exciting
time as I’ve had this summer and I don’t believe
I will ever have anything in the future that comes
up to it.”</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>By</em> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<div class="blockquotx">
<p>The sub-title “Two Boy Pioneers” indicates the nature of this
Story&mdash;that it has to do with the days when the Ohio Valley and
the Northwest country were sparsely settled. Such a topic is an
unfailing fund of interest to boys, especially when involving a
couple of stalwart young men who leave the East to make their
fortunes and to incur untold dangers.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">
<p>The author once more sends his heroes toward the setting sun.
“In all the glowing enthusiasm of youth, the youngsters seek their
fortunes in the great, fertile wilderness of northern Ohio, and
eventually achieve fair success, though their progress is hindered
and sometimes halted by adventures innumerable. It is a lively,
wholesome tale, never dull, and absorbing in interest for boys who
love the fabled life of the frontier.”&mdash;<cite>Chicago Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class="pfs150 bold lsp">THE TRAIL <em>of</em> THE SENECA</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>By</em> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<div class="blockquotx">
<p>In which we follow the romantic careers of John Jerome and
Return Kingdom a little farther.</p>

<p>These two self-reliant boys are living peaceably in their cabin
on the Cuyahoga when an Indian warrior is found dead in the
woods nearby. The Seneca accuses John of witchcraft. This means
death at the stake if he is captured. They decide that the Seneca’s
charge is made to shield himself, and set out to prove it. Mad
Anthony, then on the Ohio, comes to their aid, but all their efforts
prove futile and the lone cabin is found in ashes on their return.</p>
